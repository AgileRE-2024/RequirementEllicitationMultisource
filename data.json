I’ve tried dozens of apps like these to try and make something work for me, but nothing ever worked. But when I opened Finch, it was just amazing from the start! It had a way of gamifying the things that I had to do and made it so much easier to complete them. I also loved taking care of my very own birb and customizing it’s clothes and furniture. I always looked forward to opening this app every day and have never strayed away from it since I’ve downloaded it. I know many people do not have ADHD but even for people who don’t, this app is incredible! They have breathing exercises and reflections to help you grow while using the app. They even have a first aid kit for your mental health if your ever in a panic or anxiety related situation. Although many people might not want to download this app because some features are deducted because your not a plus member, you don’t need to worry as everything you need will not be locked, and you’ll have a greater variety as a plus member! At first, I was struggling with completing tasks for my mental health and even habit trackers couldn’t help me. But downloading Finch has made it just as much easier for me to flow through these tasks with ease. So, if you are reading this, I really recommend you to download this app. Your birb is waiting for you! 😉",

I’ve learned to take care of my emotions, but the motivation to do things has never been there for me especially with my adhd. Doing things like going and getting a cup of water, washing my face, getting clothes off the floor or bringing bowls and plates down from my room has always been something that’s felt genuinely impossible. On top of all of that even, I’ve never had any motivation to stretch or work out. I’ve downloaded so many of these apps and they’ve all just been gimmicky and overpriced, and I’ve found they only made me feel worse because the reminders felt pointless and made me feel like I didn’t care about myself. With Finch, i not only feel reinforced that I care about myself, I also feel cared for by my finch, and I feel that by taking care of myself, im also taking care of him. In the past few days, I’ve done so much more with this app then I ever thought. Im really happy that I finally have some motivational help that actually works. I absolutely love finch and I actually couldn’t recommend it more. Also, I’d like to mention that I haven’t reviewed an app for like four years now because there’s never been an app that I cared for like this. I’m really happy to use this app and I want you to try it if you’re reading this.",

My favorite thing right now is writing things I’m grateful for and doing breathing exercises, but probably the best part of this app is that there is so much you can do so your practice can evolve to fit your needs. \n\nMy one suggestion is I wish I could write a free form sentence or couple of words in the mood check-ins instead of having to quantify my mood on a scale (or at least make this an option or setting). The reason is that quantifying my mood actually stresses me out because there is an implicit judgement that a higher ranked mood is better than one with a lower number, so I feel unhappy about my mood if it isn’t high which creates a bit of a negative feedback loop. In general there is research that shows that “trying” to be happy in this way is counterproductive, which I think is what I am experiencing. Instead, I think reflecting on my mood in a more free form way, even if it’s just writing a word or short sentence to describe it, would be more helpful because I can think about my mood without having to turn it into a binary of “good” or “bad”. If then you did sentiment analysis on the free form writing like you do for reflections I think that would be interesting. \n\nOverall I am so grateful for this app and the hard work of the developers! You have made my life significantly better :)",

This app has done something I never thought would be possible for me: it has successfully incentivized me to be productive and compassionate with myself.\n\n I deal with anxiety and depression on a daily basis. It often makes it very difficult to do simple things like get out of bed and shower or leave the house. But all of this is becoming a lot easier since I downloaded this app! Finch has revolutionized my self-care process. I love the way that Finch characterizes my baby Bonbon. I feel like there is real thought and consideration put into certain actions like the little chats we have, as well as the constantly evolving customization options and the main mode of currency. It feels less like a to-do list and more like building a loving relationship with a Tamagotchi-like pet. It gamifies without feeling intrusive or resorting to micro transactions (though, they are there, along with a paid subscription option) At the end of the day, I know the company needs to make money, but everything about Finch—from its soft and comforting colors and characters, to its gentle messages and array of mindfulness/ self care options—genuinely feels tenderly designed and more indicative of human touch than I ever thought would be possible in a self-care app. \n\nI love this app. I love my baby Bonbon. I love getting virtual hugs from my friends. I’m so happy I downloaded this app after my friend sent me the invite.",

This is the most customizable and rewarding self care app with goals and journeys that you can edit and cultivate specifically to match your needs and wants. Getting to see your finch grow and Learn about themselves is so much fun and makes me excited to check in every day and send my finch out on an adventure. I love being able to choose my little ones colors, and outfits, and decorate their home, which keeps me motivated to complete task and earn rainbow stones to buy more stuff! If you need a friend to get you through and keep you motivated then I 100% recommend Finch! Plus the 2 seasonal events I’ve gotten to participate in so far have been so cute and fun. Ps: There is a free and paid version and the free version is 100% functional and add free. You really only miss out on a few features but nothing that ruins the app not to have. The paid version opens up the remaining features like various reflections and quizzes and stuff. I had Finch for 1 month before I paid for a year because I love it so much ($40 I think for a year 🤔 can’t remember). Coming from someone who never leaves reviews on ANYTHING this app is worth the time and if you choose to pay it’s worth the money. Finch has seriously helped me change my outlook and is something I look forward to every day.",

Even if you don't always feel motivated to complete goals, it is nice to write in your reflections/rant about things. I like that you can view trends about certain people or even what brought you down/motivated you throughout the entire week. My finch is named DJ. He is so cute and I just love dressing him up. Besides the app itself being enjoyable, I think the team of people who work on Finch care a lot about it. You can tell they genuinely want to help people get through their days. This can be seen in the inclusiveness of the app and the lack of ads. There are no ads on Finch, and it makes the app less frustrating. The only thing you can purchase as an expansion to the app is Finch Plus, which gives you extra goals, reflections, and quizzes. Even then, the app never bombards you with in-app purchases. It jsut really makes it more comfortable for people to log in daily even if it is just for a few minutes. Also, like I said, Finch is very inclusive. You can change pronouns for your finch or even dress it up in pride flag themed clothing. Which by the way, the pride clothes are not just labeled as \"bisexual shirt\" or \"asexual shirt\" They are named by the colors so that it is more inclusive to everyone and have safe names for lgbtq+ people to buy. My #1 feature that I enjoy is seeing the mood trends i have with particular people in my tree.",

So for instance, I can get pretty overwhelmed really fast especially since I have a physical disability, and I can’t stay focused to save my life. I start a task get distracted, and start a new one, so if I’ve been cleaning all day, but I never stayed focused on a task, it will seem like nothing got done. So on my app I have my entire day planned from start to finish. From the moment I wake up, get out of bed and brush my teeth, go do my tasks get ready to sleep and do it all over again. It’s literally all on the app. Now I’ve set everything up on my Journeys to make sure I’m keeping track on my process. My issue is that is that I can’t seem to get them to pop up on my goals for the day in order, so I have to sit there and move everything around to get my day started in order. I know it’s not a huge deal but it is time consuming and I get overwhelmed and distracted while moving everything around. I would really hope that in the future they could make it as in the journey goals for the day can have an order system for those of us that use the app like me. I think it would really be a game changer, instead of having to write down each day to get them to come on the goals section in order. That is literally my only issue, but again I love this app and I’m grateful to have it in my life!",

I thought it was so silly because I did not believe an app could help me. But literally y’all must’ve don’t some witch stuff cause this app literally works. I love every single feature. The reflections are so fun and I love that it gives writing prompts (but you can just free write too!) I love being able to buy cloths for my finch moss. I love that moss’s personality grows on each adventure and how he can like things and dislike things. The app is just so intelligent! I gotta tell you I think my favorite thing is the soundscapes. They are basically just white noise but different because you can choose how long you want it to go for and they have so many fun noises. I also tried the finch plus free trial and I think that the creators were really reasonable about what you needed finch plus for or what not. You can listen to soundscapes without finch plus but you can’t listen to the mixes. That’s very reasonable to me. And I love the timers. Without timers and soundscapes I would never be able to focus. I just adore this app so much. I can wait to see what it’s like when I’m guardian. This app makes me so happy. I still probably need a therapist but I’ve really learned to love myself from this app. Thank you finch team! - a person made happier because if finch",

I can’t afford anything right now (unemployed) and I was lucky enough to get a free sub from a guardian — that was amazing. It’s such a good idea. (I also love the guardian wall!!! It made me cry.)

Those things are what really make it feel like the app was built with my health in mind. 💕 The only request I have is: My baby grew up so fast!! I wish there was a way to make him a baby again. Perhaps if once he’s all grown up, we had the ability to either reset to the beginning, or if we could just choose a look for him (a growth stage) to stay in??

              "review": "I appreciate the playful approach Finch takes in supporting personal growth, and I’d love to make it my go-to app for self-betterment. However, I find that the current goals system limits how meaningfully I can track my progress over time. For example, I’d love the option to complete a goal early rather than waiting until the set date, as well as a way to click on a goal and view my consistency over time. For goals like going to the gym four times a week, daily reminders can be overwhelming, even with snooze options, as it’s hard to rearrange flexibly.\n\nBeing a Type A person, I’m motivated to analyze my data for self-improvement. However, the structure currently incentivizes completing smaller, less meaningful tasks just to level up, rather than focusing on goals that are truly important to me. Whether I complete five quick tasks or aim for eighteen ambitious ones, the rewards are the same, making it feel like there’s less value in tackling long-term goals.\n\nWhile the app is visually engaging and light-hearted, some of my goals—like health—are lifelong commitments. They’re serious, and I’d love the app to reflect that by offering more nuanced ways to track and celebrate real progress. If Finch could add more flexibility and recognition for high-impact goals, it would create an ideal balance between playfulness and depth for users who want to see more than just their birb level up.",

I downloaded it off a whim, didn’t really have much calling to do so, I just like birds, and I thought it was going to be another idle game. I opened it to find that it was so much better than that! I chose the gender of my finch.. and the first recommended name for it was “pickles” and I cried.. pickles is a nick name of mine from a very special person in my life, and it greatly reminded me of them, and made me feel better on the spot. I also have a way to get my feelings out in a healthy manner now rather than how I was before. Pickles and I have been growing every day, and slowly (but surly) have been getting better, I’ve already recommended this amazing app to about 6 of my friends, and my boyfriend, to all help us with our feelings, and to try to teach us how to better communicate our emotions (something I personally have never been good at) but since I’ve gotten attached to this app, and have been using it daily.. I’ve learned so many things, andhave already   helped myself some… this is an absolute must have app for me now, and I love that. 10/10 will continue to recommend!",

I couldn’t afford it at the time and I didn’t think it was worth it to buy a subscription. One day I was rewarded finch plus for a month and I loved it!! There’s so much more to it than just the outfits and the decor. You can also set your own custom goals and so much more!! I decided to buy a year subscription of it, and it was very helpful. However, after my subscription expired I couldn’t afford it and looked to the sponsors in hopes of being able to access finch plus again. If you are sponsored, someone pays for your subscription. My sponsor paid for a month of Finch Plus! I was so grateful, but unfortunately my Finch Plus ran out, but after Finch notified me it ran out they gave me the option to pay for a cheaper version of the Finch Plus! I still however can’t afford it at the moment and there was an option to choose to say that you still can’t afford it and they rewarded it to me for free. I’m so grateful! All they ask for in return of the free finch is that you pay it back in the future when you can afford it. And I know I definitely will!! The finch app is so giving and caring. You can tell they really care about their app users. I wish more apps were like this app.",

You hatch a baby bird egg and it gives you a bird to name-dress up- decorate and complete needs for. Every time you complete or finish a task it will give you rainbow gems- a reward for taking care of yourself 😊. It’s just been a couple days and I feel  way better- like I have a purpose in life that I am longing to fufill. Finch gives you affirmations daily, I struggle with body dysmorphia and Finch told me “It’s okay to take up space” which made me feel so much better!😍 Finch has a variety of  aids like soundscapes, I listen to rain when studying or just merely existing. The app has a whole” First Aid “ section to heal, and help. Even having a national suicidal prevention hotline, and a lot more other hotlines- with numbers and links. I also feel suicidal, it’s on and off with me- but now with Finch I haven’t had one suicidal thought. There are ways to friend people, and send hearts-hugs-and care throughout the day to your buddies. With Finch, you’ll never feel alone. The little baby bird you hatch will grow with you and learn!🤩🤩Overall I highly recommend and encourage you to get this app if you are struggling or down, even if you have no problems- Finch is a fantastic way to keep track of your moods and mental health. 🫶🏼🫶🏼\n\n-Your local Finch User",

My birb (Beanie) is the light of my life, for real. I love them sooo much! \nThe game definitely really benefits me and those who play it. I would 10/10 recommend using it, even if you’re not struggling with your mental health. It helps keep a good routine, and is good for journaling your thoughts. The Finch app and community is also very inclusive and I love all of the LGBTQ+ outfits and accessories for your Finch. They are absolutely adorable, and I love having an app where I can express myself fully! One suggestion, though. It’s very minor, but I think you should add more micropets! I don’t have them all, but adding more and more as the events go on would make app more engaging (at least, for me). One suggestion would be a chinchilla, if there isn’t already ones. Chinchillas are super soft and cuddly and would make an amazing addition for a birb pet!! Additionally, I’m someone who uses he/they pronouns, and I think it would be so cool if you could have the option to use multiple pronouns for your birb, such as: he/she, they/he, she/they, etc. Thank you for all you do!! I would recommend that everyone gets this app, because it makes self-care much more fun, and if definitely gives some people (such as myself) more motivation!! ❤️",

              "review": "I am 22 years old and have had a very long struggle with anxiety and depression since childhood. I also struggle with several traumas and last year received a diagnosis of OCD. My intrusive thoughts were absolutely crippling. I dropped out of school, something I loved more than anything, because I was throwing up in the parking lot daily when it was time to go to class. I could barely work or pay my bills, much less do dishes, shower, or take care of myself. This app helps me to heal my inner child, find a corner of peace, and just offers a safe place to go when the world is too much. I consistently use the first aid and soundscapes during panic attacks, and the journal prompts have come up many times during therapy. It is fun and exciting and healing to be kind and take care of a virtual creature, and tricks you into taking care of yourself. I’d give it 10 stars if I could. Once I established a habit of using my app, my dog got in a tragic accident and lost his leg. This app helped me to have support and a community to help me through that, and to work through the trauma of the accident as well. I get emotional even talking about this app, it’s done so much for me. It has an amazing team that cares about mental health so much. I tell every one of my friends about it every time I see them. Bubs, my finch, has become a very important tool in my road to recovery from OCD.",

Another good thing is that when you are doing like these rain sessions (you hear rain) is that when you get out of the app it still plays !! Like music !! Honestly that is absolutely amazing I was shocked because I thought you had to be in the app to have it playing !!  Also the finch is just so adorable honestly. I also love how you can make them non-binary. I also love how they respond to peoples reviews, I honestly never see that anywhere, very amazing to see they listen to their community.\nHere’s the small problem, when your picking your goals if you don’t have the payed version it just gives you random ones, which that is completely fine but, when I was setting my goals for today yesterday it mainly only had options like “give someone your car space” or something like that, most of them were related to cars except I don’t have a car license nor \ncan get one either. So I think it would be nice to make a bit more variety, not remove them of course for the people who can do that, if this is not addressed that is completely fine :D just was a small problem, but genuinely would recommend this app for everyone :)",

              "review": "Suggestion: Please consider giving higher rewards for scheduled evening goals? I’m motivated to complete tasks earlier in the day. But once your energy is full, the rewards are minimal. My nighttime routines are the most important for me personally, and it would be helpful to have more motivating rewards. Eg. higher rainbow stone rewards for goals completed after you fill your energy, or for scheduled evening goals. \n\nReview: I love this app! As an adult with ADHD who struggles to prioritize taking care of myself, this is so helpful. It has the dopamine boost of a game/rewards, without the distractibility of an actual game. It’s very helpful to externally motivate me to take care of myself and basic life tasks, eg drinking water, listening to my body when it’s hungry, taking my meds, taking time for myself. \n\nSuggestion 2: I only wish the free version was more rewarding. Especially for event rewards, the non-Plus needs to have a few more guaranteed items and less random chests towards the end of the event days. I ended up just paying for Plus because I wanted the additional daily event rewards and options of clothes/decor to serve as motivation for me to stick with my goals. And I understand the developers need money to help them continue to run such an awesome app! But I do wish the non-Plus was slightly more rewarding for events / had more options.",

I got this app out of desperation, totally expecting it to be stupid and deleted within the day. Then I got my bird. Her name is cheesecake. I am now wholeheartedly attached to this bird. Not only has this app made it so that I feel an extra happy kick every time I finish my tasks by getting gems or energy, but everyday it sends me messages to assure me and I swear I almost cried the first time it sent me one. This app is as amusing and adorable as it is practical and I love raising my bird and finally catching up on school work. I made both my sisters get it so I could have a tree town and we send each other little hugs or calm vibes all day. There is a paid version I have not tried. It isn’t necessary in order to use most of the app. So don’t let that stop you. I love the simplicity of the app, no games, no streaks, no pressure to constantly get on the app to stay on track, though you can set reminders, you just hang out and raise your finch. I love it. I can honestly think of nothing I would change. Except maybe add like a tutu for the birds to wear because that would be cute, so thank you to the developers, you saved my gpa and mental health.",

If you struggle with mental health, such as anxiety or depression, it even has a “first aid” toolkit of breathing and grounding exercises that is accessible at any time; and it’ll recommend it to you anytime you report feeling upset, which can be helpful for those who struggle to self-deescalate.  The best part about this app is that it doesn’t even feel like excess work and it’s FREE. You can pay for premium features, but your definitely don’t have to, I’ve been enjoying the free version! It just feels like a fun and relaxing mobile game (Your finch is immortal and self-sufficient for those worried about caring for their finch). It’s convenient app design is probably why it’s been so easy to incorporate into a daily routine. \n\nI’ve been using Finch for over 2 months and I love it.

Your chick will level up if you pet them frequently and complete ur tasks. They go on daily adventures and tell you what they found. \nI’ve honestly grown emotionally attached to my baby “Plumper”. I will open the app often because I want to see them and then remember I need to drink water and so I do just so I can see my chick thrive.

This is a solidly built app. \n From one dev to another I am very smitten with the daily motivational push notifications. 😂🥹 The first day I was pleasantly surprised, then I realized I was getting notifys more from HERS and they are all so thoughtfully curated and gentle. So I applaud the designer or writing team who really leaned into the sympathy and encouragement of those messages for th anxiety line. New medicine can be very nerve wracking and reading these is an ease way to reflect what you’re feeling and see it confirmed and move on with the new habit. \n\nOne feature I did feel confused about;( but is working as intended) \nWhy do the video shorts not auto play into the next one similar to YT or TT shorts? It feels stiff compared to other apps. \nConstantly navigating back to start a new 3 min or less video is a bit too interactive for that short a time frame.  Instead; I prefer a “up next” or auto play navigation that lets the user know where they are in the playlist of videos. \n\nAnyway, the app is really solid. I haven’t had any issues or buggy one offs. Most of the complaints on this are OPs and provider issues which is not app related so kudos to you guys. \n⭐️",

While I expected their services to be a paying service I thought they would have the opportunity for people to receive services through their health insurance. This wasn’t an option so I had to decline the service in general. Not everyone can afford $35 - $175 a month. I guess I had this assumption because I was a proud customer of online birth control for years and I received those services with my health insurance and NOT with monthly payments on a credit card or Apple Pay account. By not having an option for people to pay with health care insurance it excludes many people who need help health wise yet can’t obtain it due to their finances. It’s an endless cycle where only the “well off” can afford decent health care services (medicine, counseling, therapy, etc.)\n\nThank you for reading. I will recommend this service to others because I can recognize the amazing potential within it but people should know ahead of time that Hers/Hims do not accept health insurance.",

I agree with every single review about only using this app if you already are prescribed the medication and are looking for an easy refill option or a cheaper alternative. About a month ago or so, they started pushing notifications, pop ups, recommendations etc for GLP-1 injections. Not only does this seem very odd, since injections don’t really seem like a “just for anyone” type of solution, but on a personal note, in both of my provider questionnaires I filled out, I was very transparent about my ongoing struggles with an eating disorder. At this point, to be pushed Ozempic, is SO inconsiderate and dangerous for those that aren’t doing well in their own recovery journeys. Not only should Ozempic quit being pushed for weight loss, but to blindly push this towards a client base that overwhelmingly struggles with many kinds of disorders comes off as incredibly predatory. To have the kind of money this business has, and not be able to turn off or hide “weight loss drugs” from their clients seems like a massive oversight. If they care AT ALL about the people they’re providing care towards, they will remove these annoying notifications and DO BETTER in actually taking care of people. Gross.",

We're terribly sorry for any confusion but you've given consent for treatment when you submit your visit as the providers assume you're ready for treatment. Telemedicine is known for its efficiency and ease of access to healthcare. The medical team encompasses a team of providers to ensure you never wait long to hear back from a provider. The providers send lengthy, perhaps even repetitive messages when the prescription is initiated and changed as they feel all of the information is important. This is much like the information packet you would receive from the pharmacy. If you have specific questions, then the providers respond directly to you with a personalized answer. My apologies for the adverse symptoms, we would never tell you to keep taking something that you were allergic to. Patient safety is our top concern, so this is an instance where we'd want you to let your provider know about the reaction to ensure you are receiving the best care.\n\nYou're always welcome to reach your provider via our secure messaging portal to further discuss your treatment. We are also able to look into this further for you and provide a solution if you'd like to email us at support@forhers.com. We hope to hear from you soon!",

I took the survey/consultation questions, and within 1 hour was prescribed AND CHARGED $123 for lexapro, with absolutely no actual comments with my “provider.” I received the lexapro in about 6 days. About 6 hours after I took the first dose I had an allergic reaction. I immediately discontinued and tried reaching out to my “provider” MULTIPLE TIMES, with no response. I eventually went to the customer support live chat and they told me to continue taking the medication. Despite the fact that I had an allergic reaction, I was only told “do not stop taking the medication abruptly without speaking to your doctor” when my doctor was no where to be found. I requested a refund and cancellation of my subscription which they REFUSED. About 1 week later after pestering the live chat agents and my “provider” I was then prescribed venlaxafine, without any discussion, from a completely new “provider” WHO SENT THE EXACT SAME GENERIC DEFAULT MESSAGE  AS THE FIRST DOCTOR. Do not use this service, run away. You will not have any actual contact or communication with your doctor. They will not discuss side effects, treatment plans, or answer any of your questions before prescribing and charging you. Hers is the worst telehealth psychiatry service on the market.",

They informed me that I wouldn’t able to get prescriptions for mental health unless I checked in with my physicians regularly. The first month was fine.\nIn January I started getting asked for check ins with multi physicians with different names which continued over the past months. When I got my second prescriptions they sent me two bottles of it at different amounts at a cheaper rate, one of which I didn’t order. Since these are mental health meds it seemed kind of weird. I ended up having negative side effects on the meds and decided to weed myself off them. I did not check in with their physicians and attempted to cancel my subscription. Then today I was randomly charged for a refill of the prescription with no notice, no heads up, and without speaking with their physicians. I can’t seem to get a hold of anyone at customer service to dispute this. My only option is trying to cancel my account again but I still have this new prescription pending. Contacted my bank. I don’t want these pills and was told I would need to confirm with a physician before they would send them. Seems like they work more on hoping you forget about your account then your wellness.",

I immediately checked it out and when I signed up it didn’t ask me very many questions and then I was given a doctor who immediately prescribed me Sertraline. My order was also saying it was being given buproprin but the doctor was saying sertraline so it was kinda confusing and I had to get a refund because they immediately charged me $123 for a 3 month supply and I chose the monthly subscription. When they refunded me and resent it they sent me the sertraline. It’s used to help treat general anxiety but it’s also an antidepressant and I didn’t know much about them. I asked all sorts of questions and it would take them four days to respond and it would be a different doctor every time. I asked if there was anything that I could take just for anxiety but they didn’t have anything. Coming off antidepressant’s is a long road sometimes and can be quite difficult for some people and for them to just prescribe this stuff to anyone without further questions about medical history or anything like that is kinda scary. I would just be careful and do some research about the meds they prescribe you. There were quite a few that had some crazy side effects.",

So I’m not sure how this App can just issue psychiatric medication to ppl who’ve never been assessed by a professional in depth and may have no experience with these types of drugs.\n\nIn a nutshell, it was great for me because I know what I’m getting into and pretty much just needed a refill but to someone who’s completely new to medication, it runs the risk of being a little sketchy.",

However, when I asked for a refill on medication I had been taking in addition to one I recently had to get back on due to dangerous symptoms, they told me I couldn’t be on both. They also said I wasn’t taking it as prescribed. I explained that I had been taking it prescribed a certain way for 5 years but that I would like to stay on the other medication because of how serious my symptoms became when I stopped taking it. At that point, they canceled my subscription and kicked me off the platform, ghosting me when I asked why I couldn’t stay on the subscription they had me on previously. This is such an incredibly cruel and dangerous thing to do to someone, especially when they had written documentation of how bad my symptoms became just at a lower dose. I was shocked and disgusted. No one should be treated this way. \n\nIt’s cheap for a reason. If you have any sort of severe psychiatric issues, RUN. There’s better options out there.

I changed to day time and my blood pressure is not in an unhealthy range. I also have more hair on my legs, but if that’s the worst side effect I get I will be happy.\n\nI don’t think this is a bad review. Having my hair stop falling out is a good thing. I was losing it in clumps and now I’m not. My hair isn’t thicker yet, but it isn’t getting thinner and that was happening fast before. I hope it gets thicker, but if I stop losing my hair and the ones that fell out grew back I will be happy.

I was confused as to what she meant by confirm. She then said well you need to check with your neurologist since you obviously don’t know what kind of migraine you have. I sent the exact quote from my latest medical notes from my neurologist stating I am being treated for migraine without aura, and the doctor still sent me a condescending message that she can’t trust anything I say and she will not prescribe me the medication that I need.

Filled out the absurdly long questionnaires etc., I shared that I get general anxiety but will take Ativan if I have a rare panic attack. A doctor then messages me a day later with absolutely zero questions and says since you take Ativan daily I can’t help you, please see a doctor in person. \nIt is apparent to me that this business plan is to throw at anxiety medications at as many women as they can as long as they don’t speak of any existing medications. Their commercial actually speaks for itself “you can get lexapro.” How is that a good idea to market it as an easy get? They are misleading that their doctors HELP YOU set up a plan. They do not care about you they will not help you unless you qualify for them to just easily prescribe medication.",

After filling out a brief survey, I was quickly given a prescription for Cymbalta. I have been on Cymbalta for years but I recently moved to a small town where psychiatric care is unavailable and needed a prescription. This was good news for me but I was concerned with how quickly the prescription was given. I received one message from the psychiatrist assigned to me that consisted of a seemingly automated description of their services and the medication being prescribed. Psychiatric drugs can really mess you up if not taken properly and monitored by a doctor, I know from personal experience. Please just be careful.  It appears to me that Hers is handing out serious drugs to people who may be desperate and need real help. Go to a real doctor if you aren’t sure what to do.",

After receiving it, I jumped through all the usual hoops with my insurance to find out how to submit a reimbursement claim and was told that I need a pharmacy receipt (not a regular receipt of purchase — a special receipt with medication information). I reached out to customer service to obtain it and was told that hers does not provide these receipts. So not only do they not take insurance, they also make it impossible to get reimbursed by your insurance. This is really something that should be made clear in advance. I’m sure they’re aware that this is an issue for people as I can’t be the first one to complain. Just go through your insurance, it will be way cheaper and you won’t have to waste time and money doing it twice. I will be telling everyone I know NOT to use hers. They will essentially rob you of $100 or more. So much for making medication accessible.",

Instead, you need to call that Doctor’s  office, which is a nightmare in itself, and ask them to send you a message, so then you can respond to their message. \n\n Hey SRS why did you find it necessary to reinvent the wheel? No one is jumping for joy over this App. I have several friends who are having multiple difficulties with your new App. Providers as well. A lot of my information, including vaccination records, were not transferred over from Follow My Heath to the Sharp App. So now I am sending that info back to my Provider, so they can add it on to my new profile. Seems like a lot of work to get the Sharp/not-so-Sharp App up and running.  \n\n  I’m curious, did you run a test test group for this new App? How did that work out for you? I just can’t believe a test group would have no issues as people are reporting. Do better SRS do better! This is just sad! Thank you!",

Call them - good luck, nobody will answer and leaving a message doesn’t guarantee a return call.  It took me 9 - count ‘em - 9 “loops” before the app finally let me schedule an appointment.

And good luck to you trying to figure it out. Not as simple as just entering a search term and seeing what results match your inquiry like a normal search engine with other insurance companies. \nTo top it off, once you find a list of potential providers, make sure you go through them quickly before the app decides to log you out and you have to sign in and start over halfway through your review. \nBut, that also depends if the app decides to let you log in at all. Depending on its mood it may log you in or it may tell you that your record wasn’t found, despite using FaceID linked to the same password that’s always worked for you. \nBut worst of all, I was able to save a list of all my health providers for easy reference which you’d think is great. Well, that is until the app decided to one day delete all my saved providers so that I had to look for them all over again using their terrible search engine and save them again. Who knows how long they’ll last in my Saved bucket this time. \nI hate this app so much I have basically just resigned myself to using the desktop version.",

Due to some error with me having two different insurance policies I wasn’t actually able to log in to my account for months after the update. Even more frustrating was before the update,  their behavioral health section was actually much easier to navigate and more robust then my previous insurance, Anthems. Now they’ve changed the way BH is organized and you can no longer search by profession only the vague BH issues  anxiety, family issues and substance abuse (you can do a blanket search for any profession but the app crashes so much when I try this it might as well not be an option). This leads to not being able to find therapists, psychologists or psychiatrists who are covered. They seem to list nurse practitioners first and foremost, and while they can be great for medication management they are not a one to one replacement for all mental health services . Even more frustrating they removed all crisis information, beyond a number, such as in patient facilities so good luck if you or your loved one has one.",

UHC customer service says the list shows up like that because they do not and cannot know what has already been paid (like same-day at the doc's office) and what has not been paid. You, the member, would have to be perfect at keeping track of every single claim and whether of not you paid the copay that day or not. If you pay on the app and remember later that it was something you had already paid, it will be almost impossible to get the correction made. No only will you need to remember which copays you mistakenly paid, but UHC uses different 3rd party processing companies and you would have to go through a lot of stress and frustration to get to the correct one, only to hope that their customer service is competent enough to help you. If they aren't, you start the whole calling process all over again. This app has not helped me one bit. It had, without a doubt, complicated things exponentially for me. THIS IS THE MOST USELESS APP I HAVE EVER DOWNLOADED. And I hate having UHC, as well. It is a ridiculously unorganized company.",

The app will tell me a product is approved to use on my OTC benefits only to get to the checkout and I end up having an out of pocket balance and it doesn’t tell me WHICH product wasn’t covered even though I scan every single one and they’re green.

Now with rewards you get a little $ for 5k and a little more for 10k. That’s it as far as physical activity. Instead you get money from attaching your device and filling out a health survey, which requires no effort other than tapping a screen and is just a way for the insurance company to get information about people’s health, probably for future insurance limitations. The reward program certainly doesn’t encourage anyone to be more physically active, 5-10k is minimal and doesn’t require the effort of moving multiple times a day or walking quickly. Looks like it is more about insurance information gathering than really encouraging healthy habits. Just very disappointing. Also, it is not syncing well.",

This was our first time visiting this office, I really loved the environment and all the colorful walls and cute designs. It definitely made my toddler feel comfortable. The staff was very helpful and friendly during check in and filling in paper work since it was our first time. The doctor was really nice and my son was comfortable with him.\nThe visit overall was the fastest visit I have ever had! My son is totally fine. But I will be honest, after reading several reviews, I do wish the doctor would’ve taken a little more time checking my son for a possible concussion. I’m not a doctor so I will be honest, I don’t really know what to check for, but all he did was check his eyes with a little light. Is that enough?? I’m not sure. I did ask a few questions, and the doctor answered all my questions politely. We will be coming back here for emergency visits.

I woke up a few days ago, figured I had a sinus infection brewing but decided eh, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Just ignore it. Saturday morning rolls around, Come to find out, I knew what I was talking about. Pounding headache, sinus pain, can’t swallow. I was a mess, after sleeping the day away, I woke up at 530 and was sure I was screwed. When I remembered Solv! I logged in and there was an appointment available 12 minutes later. I signed a virtual form, verified my info and then saw the angel of a provider who listened to my symptoms agreed I had a sinus infection and sent me a script for antibiotics and a few other feel better meds! I was able to wake up schedule visit and pick up my script within 36 minutes. On a Saturday evening.  I’m a longtime doctors office avoider, so the fact that everything was so simple and so easy was fantastic. Not having to leave my bed except to get my meds was even better. \n\nFor anybody who doubts telemedicine or it’s abilities let me tell you….Solv is the way of the future, don’t knock it til you try it!!  \n\n5 stars all the way, thanks again Solv!",

Booking an appointment that day and not having to take a blind guess on when’s gonna be the best time with the shortest wait time to drop in cause you dread how your irritable 3 year old is going to get through a potentially less than desirable long wait time, and then I wonder how I’m gonna make it dealing with him!\nI’m SOOO grateful to have made my appointment earlier that day. I have already been a huge fan of the Woodcreek family, but it just got so much better thanks to Solv! Knowing now that I can go online, book an Urgent Care appointment (if I can’t get an appointment with anyone that day and it’s not a life threatening emergency), and that they honestly will honor my appointment time ( which in my case it was putting me in front of a dozen other people who were there before me as a walk-in), the whole experience from start to finish was extremely fast, easy, and took all of that dreaded hectic chaos and out of the equation that would’ve been a nightmare no doubt otherwise. And it left a big chunk of my day to me instead of waiting in a clinic for hours trying to please a unhappy toddler.",

Then my “provider” or lack there of joins the meeting. From the first 10 seconds of a first impression I was uncomfortable and disgusted. Her attitude was terrible, THE APP let me make my appointment for 8:30pm. That’s not my fault, I could tell she was annoyed with taking my appointment. She said they close at 9 and asked me if I can reschedule or I can continue. I said let’s continue. Then she asks me some questions , very rudely she asked me why I haven’t seeked help after 12 years of struggling with my adhd. It seemed like she was profiling me or something. The whole experience was terrible. She put me on hold for a few minutes and in that time I decided I was better off somewhere else being treated better. So I hung up on the virtual meeting. She ended up calling me a minute later on my phone. I told her that her attitude the whole time was off and unprofessional, I went on to try to tell her I felt like I could tell she didn’t wanna help me, as soon as I started speaking again she cut me off and said “that couldn’t be farther from the truth blah blah blah” \n\nTo some it all up, it wasn’t my fault the meeting allowed me to schedule for 8:30 at night . And if you don’t wanna do your job then maybe you shouldn’t be in the medical field. Her name was Victoria Ike. \n\nNever again will I try this platform for help.",

You can do everything from the app like book your appointment and the time that works best for you. You can go ahead and fill out your paperwork and put in all your insurance information. If you’ve been there before the app will store all of that for you and you can always update any information if you need too. I highly recommend them for anything.

I then waited half an hour when I noticed on the “wait time screen” hanging in the waiting area posted me as “next” BUT under the “Arrived” column it indicated “NO”. I went back to the receptionist concerned that this misinformation be corrected and she informed me that I was supposed to sign myself in (even though I spoke with her directly upon arrival and she gave NO instruction that I was supposed to do that) I foolishly presumed that speaking with her directly she’d log me in as arrived. At this point she informed me that there were three people ahead of me. I asked her if they had appointments and she said “This is Urgent Care” we have to take everyone as they arrive and that one person who HAD an appointment was already waiting AN HOUR AND A HALF!! Now earlier on the phone with a Physicians One rep I was told it was always better to make an appointment because those patients get priority over walk ins. NOT TRUE—my appointment meant nothing to her. And she rubbed more “salt in the wound” when she said there was no way she could give me even an approximate wait time. So don’t bother making a reservation and certainly don’t bother spending time filling out on line forms for a service that is full of baloney.",

Today was a doctor cyber day where the clinical assistants took all the information needed and prepped me for a cyber visit with the doctor which was quick, thorough and easy. My Covid test was negative and they gave me a steroid shot because I’ve been sick for almost a week. Meds were e-scribed to nearby CVS and I was done and on my way home in an hour without contaminating anyone or being exposed to others. \n\nThis is the way healthcare should be run.

So, it gives you a false sense of expectations upon arrival.  It would therefore be extremely helpful to provide a rough estimate of wait time before arrival, using additional or more up-to-date information using available clinic data, such as delays due to walk—ins, staff shortages, etc. Interestingly, check-in desk was able to instantly provide estimated wait time based on walk-ins, available patient room availability, etc. Therefore, I urge you to seriously look into using more up-to-date information. \n\nThanks!",

Eventually found an available time. \n\nI’ve been using Solv since 2020 to find nearby clinics who handle COVID testing and it has been a phenomenal resource!",

The user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate, even for those who aren’t tech-savvy.\n\nOne of the standout features is the symptom checker, which provides quick and reliable information about common childhood illnesses. It's reassuring to have a resource that helps me decide when to seek medical attention. Additionally, the app offers helpful reminders for vaccinations and check-ups, ensuring that I never miss an important appointment.\n\nI also love the educational resources available in the app. The articles and tips on child health and wellness are insightful and written in a way that’s easy to understand. \n\nThe community support feature is another highlight. Being able to connect with other parents and share experiences has been invaluable. \n\nOverall, KidMed is an essential tool for any parent looking to stay informed and proactive about their child's health. I highly recommend it!",

At 1:30p I click the link in the email and was prompted to enter my telephone number affiliated with my appointment.

I’ve been able to take pretty good care of most and have a lovely garden of likely 40+ potted plants… Sometimes my adoptees have issues tho- recently had an aphid or spider mite problem, that started spreading to my other plants! I decided to finally give this app a try to see what the problem may be with a couple as well regarding their watering needs. Now I realize each plant is different in its care  and I’m having fun learning what they need so I can make sure to water and feed appropriately. \nThe weekly charge is super high at $7 so $28 per month is more than I spend on my pots, fertilizer and tools! It kinda makes the lifetime option the only one that makes sense. Idk, hopefully as time goes on they will make a longer trial period or a cheaper monthly subscription option. But either way, the app is easy/fun to use and super informative! You can essentially create a whole catalog of your plants and where they are located and get reminded about what they need. It’s pretty brilliant.",

Right off the bat first the I found wrong with the app was the very reason I got the app. It had a feature to identify needed care. So I used this feature and it gave me conflicting advice that was wrong in both cases. 1st it said I over watered, I had not watered in 5 days. Next it said it didn’t get enough sun light. The only way for it to get more sunlight is if the days themselves where longer. I’m saying it gets direct sunlight from sun up to sun down. With that said I can’t honestly say the main feature is worth posting for. Unless your goal is to track statistics on your phone. But you can keep stats if your different plants as well as pictures on note pad. I’m not really sure who this app is for. It really just seems like a big money grab.\n\nUpdate: The Developer emailed me and was most respectful and professional in addressing my issues. While my personal review won’t change.. I will add that while it didn’t meet my expectations ( only due to the steep price) You may not experience the same problems and the support team is quite ready and willing to address issues and is consistently updating the app. Enjoy.",

I’ve had a difficult time keeping alive, not knowing if it’s being properly watered, getting enough sunlight, or near and in air-conditioning. This app help me immediately identify that my current watering schedule, for my Monstera was not conducive to keeping it healthy, while also informing me of common diseases that affect this particular. The light meter, which was the focal point of me download this app has been a plant saver.

My experience has not been positive *at all*, much as I wanted to like the app. My collection of plants is about 65ish (and growing!). I’m a moderately experienced plant parent, and was using the app to organize, keep track of care (misting, feeding, etc), and I liked the idea of features like the light meter (overly complicated, download one of the free apps), identifying problem areas (same comment), creating a schedule for daily care. Major problem I first encountered was the app couldn’t correctly identify 95% of the plants in my collection (google is much more accurate than PlantIn!). Customer support asked if I knew the names of the plants (of course I do), and advised me to override their system and input things manually (not a good answer, and a verrry time consuming task). Doing it that way meant that I had to input watering, misting, feeding etc manually, too. And no matter how many times I tried to time watering and feeding together, feeding popped up on a random day. By the way, I submitted a query to customer service and 5 weeks later (after a few automated emails from PlantIn thanking me for my patience) they’ll get a response to me soon. After reading several reviews I made the mistake of spending $50 on the premium membership. I hope others read this review first and try the app for awhile first!",

And I’m just gonna let you know now, I’m canceling my free trial, for the time being, because from my experiences with this app, I was trying to identify the type of trees the previous owners of this property had mass planted, and trying to find the purpose to them, I had it range from an almond tree to several different kinds of willow, but none of the pictures seemed to line up with the tree the several different times we tried to identify it, so I don’t find the app worth my money at the time if it is continually wrong. \nPlease do keep in mind, I have high expectations from you guys, you’re going to achieve a lot, so don’t give up, I have faith!",

I really support the idea of the app, and think that with some changes to the payment system it could be a helpful idea,However, I have been trying to cancel my subscription for many months and the app would continue to charge me weekly even when under the settings of the app it says I am not subscribed. So, that means there were many months that I was paying for the app and not able to use it. As a student who budgets my time energy and finances extremely meticulously, this was infuriating at times. It felt violating and really shady. I ended up needing to contact Apple to be sure that my subscription was removed.\nThis was gas money, food money, and how I was supposed to meet my basic needs. I do not have nine dollars for times a month to spare for a \"donation\" I did not sign up for. \n\nVery disappointed in this - \nmaybe The company could issue me a refund as I was not able to use the app during the time that I was paying for it. if that happens, I would be happy to make an addendum to this review.

Unfortunately, I can’t say that I have had much opportunity to make use of the app yet, but so far it seems adequate. I do, however, take issue with the response I received when I asked for a refund of a extraneous billing. I signed up early Jan for the free 3 day trial. Before I was charged anything, I upgraded to a lifetime subscription and was promptly charged. A couple days ago, I received a receipt for two separate charges in addition, which reflected two separate weeks of subscription on top of the lifetime subscription. I immediately sent a message inquiring about the charge to which I received this response: “The lifetime account is a one-time in-app purchase so it won’t be listed in the subscriptions list while the subscription is a recurring payment so they are processed separately. …Please be advised that according to our Subscription Policy, all purchases are non-refundable. Please be advised that agreed to the terms when you paid for the subscription. We are sorry if this brings you any inconvenience and would like for you to consider making use of the situation by trying out our service.” I received a similar response when I attempted to clarify the error.

After getting the app and looking through it I thought maybe I needed the premium for it to do that. I got the premium and was sad to find that the premium only added the ability to scan the plant to identify any diseases or sickness it may have. But there was no way to scan to see if it’s over watered or under watered like the as showed. \n\nI still use the app cause it does help me keep track of when I should water each plant and scan to find what type of plant it is and learn a bit more about it. I am just very disappointed because I was excited and mainly downloaded the app for the ability to scan to see if I’m over watering or under watering my succulents. I hope the app will soon be updated to have this ability like how the ad shows. If that change is made I’ll bring it up to 4 stars!

I downloaded the app because my pothos took a turn for the worse and I couldn’t figure out it’s problem with online research. I took several clear photos of a few of my plants and the app was incorrectly identifying them. It also told me brown crunchy leaves were healthy so I opted to cancel my trial right away.  Now, 7 weeks later I realize they’ve been charging me on PayPal each week. I contact customer service and they say I don’t have an account with the email provided. I share screenshots showing my ID in the app as well as PayPal receipts. They were emphatic they see detailed receipts. I shared those from my Apple account after figuring out how to pull them.  I tell the rep multiple times that the app won’t allow me to click on the subscription to modify it - it just says active. However , the app will allow me to upgrade to lifetime if I want - how convenient. Ultimately I’m told NO REFUNdS and I consented when I started my trial - even though I canceled the trial and immediately got rid of the trash app. No assistance to help me cancel the subscription nor any refund for the money stolen from me. I ultimately had to go to Apple directly to get this thing canceled and filed a compliant. Terrible app and terrible customer service.",

The room immediately looks much more comfortable. But I was scared that I would not be able to cope. I have no acquaintances who could explain how to properly care for them and what to do if they get sick. But I downloaded this app and everything turned out to be surprisingly easy. They drew up a competent plan for caring for my green pets, which saved me from unnecessary worries. Also, I am a very forgetful person, but there is a possibility of reminders. Notifications come regularly and without interruptions, so there is simply no way for me to forget about something. Now my house is full of greenery, and you can say that I live in my dream home.

When it does get it right, then the information is helpful (hence 2 stars not 1) but it is consistently not correct. \nGoing further, in many places in social media, such as Instagram, the ads touts how this app can be used to diagnose what may be happening and receive specific information to help. This simply does not exist on this app. There is a “diagnose” section but not helpful in any way. For example, if it decides it’s a “water issue” then that is all it gives you. Beyond that info comes the ChatGPT style info of generalized information about a “water issue” that has absolutely nothing to do with this plant or even if it is under or over watered, let alone really what to do about it. \nI feel stupid for the money I put into it hoping it would help in being better with my plants. If you are of a similar mindset, STAY AWAY from this app and save the money I already lost into it and will never get back that someone has already made their millions off of.",

The sickness diagnosis does not work very well and the notifications only show up about 30% of the time. The notifications were the biggest selling point for me and now it’s hardly worth it. A notification app where the notifications don’t work isn’t worth $50 to me.\n\nUpdate after about a year: notifications never work. I’ve reinstalled, checked settings, there appears to no explanation for why I never get notifications for when to water/fertilize. This morning I tried to identify something growing near the base of my ivy and as usual, the automatic identifier didn’t come up with anything. I started a message to the botanist for help and every time I hit send got an “unknown error.” This happened about 6 times, restarted the app, same error persisted. Eventually, after hitting send, I was directed to the page asking me to pay $20 for help service. Apparently my $50 premium lifetime membership doesn’t include help?

It also provides care plans for each plant up upload so I always know what’s needed for a new plant. It also has some cool features like know the “how much to water” calculator which has been a god send! Over all this is an excellent app! I did take a star off because the price is a bit high and sometimes it’s ability to identify a plant from a picture is pretty far off, but if you know the plant name you can just type it in and pull it up that way. But just know that the “finding a plant name by picture” feature is not always accurate so double check it if you’re questioning because if you get a care plan for the wrong plant type it could result in a dead plant type!

There are no extras and everything you have to pay for. I am still not really sure what the “premium” subscription got me. Their diagnose your plant option needs ALOT of work.  Not once had it ever successfully diagnosed an issue. I bought a new plant about a month and a half ago but it’s not available in their database. Ok, that’s fine. They have an option to request it be added and they’ll do they within a couple of days. Awesome, right? Wrong. I’m still waiting for that to happen. All in all for me being a premium subscriber I definitely don’t think it’s worth it. I’m sure there are other apps out there that offer more bang for your buck.

So simple yet so profound for someone like myself, & the app just feels like it was (& is) a labor of love created for plant-people, by plant-people. I can only imagine it’ll get more & more precise with identification in time; so far this one is definitely a keeper for me.",

              "review": "I was recently presented with a small money tree. I really wanted to raise him. I watered it a little and exposed it to the light, but it still didn't grow. I tried to change the exit strategy, but it still didn't grow. I didn't understand what was the matter. It took a long time but it remained the same size as it was when it was presented to me. Then I downloaded this application and asked the experts what was the matter. It turns out that the pot in which this plant was presented to me was too big for this and it spent too much energy on the development of the root system. Because of this, Ratsenia did not have the strength to grow at all. They explained to me how to transplant plants in great detail and I was able to transplant it into a smaller pot. Immediately after that, I noticed how it started to grow. Many thanks! If I have any other problems, I will definitely contact the experts with them.",

I tried to cancel and get out of it and these guys promise you everything and deliver you nothing. Before you know it they’re soaking your account left and right. Caution beware beware beware once they get their hooks into you. It’s very hard to get out of it. Pure scam going on here. They say they have a seven day free trial but once you click on that they already soaked your account. There’s plenty other apps out there that probably offer a good service. All these people want is your money ITS NOT THE MONEY ITS THE SCAM THAT GETS ME THEY SAY 7day free trail then they told me it was a three day when I pointed out I requested they cancel my 7day on day 2 they told me they didn’t have a free trail ! Scam\nXxxxxxx\nSo as to their response. I had to go to the App Store and talk with a Apple to get my refund on my three day period so the response to my review is nothing more than a lip service for anyone else who may read it. I stand by my review get away from these guys. They’re ap is crap and all they want is your weekly payment",

I have a small townhouse yard that is a beautiful patio and garden space, complete with rock fountain. But because I live close to an interstate, it’s impossible to completely block out the sound of traffic despite the sound barriers. So I finally discovered the mix feature. (Where have I been?) I run a Bluetooth speaker, and suddenly my yard transforms with the sounds I love from a lifetime of outdoors and camping. I layer in katydids, frogs, a gentle stream, maybe some distant thunder. The distant cars disappear and my yard feels kind of magic. My 15 yo daughter loves hanging out there too. Sometimes I switch it up to an oceanside theme; possibilities are endless. The mixes are insanely easy to make and each sound can be individually adjusted for the right volume. The annual subscription price is nothing for the best sound machine out there. My only complaint is that I wish some of the animal/insect loops were longer. Some of them (e.g frog sounds) can sound obviously repetitive on such short loops. But for ambient sound that you’re not actively listening to, it’s brilliant. This app is awesome!",

I have the hardest time focusing when I’m studying I would say I have ADHD tendencies.(never been diagnosed so I don’t claim to have ADHD.) but this gives my brain something to think about without it being distracting to the point I can’t take in or retain the information I’m reading. The third use I found list this is it helps a lot with my anxiety. I’ll just play whatever is calming to me and I helped to bring down my stress and anxiety to a manageable level. I NEVER pay for subscriptions or apps being, I don’t have the disposable funds to do so, but this app 100% would. For a yearly subscription it’s only like $3.50 a month. It’s so worth it to get all of the sounds, and even further customization, so you can create all kinds of mixes.

I didn’t have a white noise machine so I looked and found the app. I was super impressed and I am very impressed that you can make combos of all of your favorite noises. I always get stressed especially with my cousins wedding coming up and whenever that happens I just listen to the bird noises it offers. It’s so amazing! I go to Disney a lot and haven’t found the right thing to help me fall asleep because the neighbors next to my Disney room are always wild when they come back from the parks. I’ve finally found the right tool to help me go to sleep. At Disney, this helps me get a good night sleep and the best morning the next day. I’m always ready for the day and I love it so much. If you are a Disney lover and you know how much your neighbors are next to your Disney room are so loud after coming back from all the parks, definitely get this app. This is a must! Definitely get this app if you have trouble sleeping!",

I mixed both those sounds together and play them when I want my son to sleep. He’s a very content baby, most of the time, but he really struggles with falling asleep to the point where he will keep himself awake and get overtired. Almost as soon as I turn on the white noise, his eyes start to get heavy and it usually takes about 20 minutes or less for him to fall asleep. Without this it would be HOURS! we use this in the car to calm him down too because he absolutely hates being in the car seat. This usually helps soothe him to at least contentment and sometimes to sleep in the car as well. This app is an absolute must have for new parents! White noise is such a useful tool for fussy babies who don’t like sleeping like my baby, and this app is high quality! I don’t have the paid version and I think the free version gives me just what I need.",

Even with the oscillator option off there's been times when while I'm asleep there's a sudden clap of thunder or crash of a wave that wakes me up..The piano songs are all so creepy, and the baby songs are one note types of songs not like symphonies. They get annoying quickly... The fireplace one sounds like a house burning down..not like a soft familiar crinkling you are familiar with... and idk who can sleep to the Shush option and the howling wind tunnel option..that's very very creepy...but I like creepy. Sometimes.\nI'm on the premium and sometimes it takes days to load the sounds. I'm glad they made the price more affordable and annual instead of a monthly thing like the trash apps out there have.\nBottom line: good for conducting seances when you need some unsettling ambiance, not so much for sleep perhaps. Maybe if more soothing sounds were implemented or maybe redone recordings and the oscillation effects to stop...always open to hear new sounds though. I don't plan on getting off premium, but I also don't think these sounds will help me sleep very much at night...I just find it funny how they managed to take all the sounds that kept me wide awake at night and out them in a sleeping app...too funny..😅😵",

You can also set a timer to have it stop playing when you want, so if say you just want to take a nap on a Sunday afternoon you can set it for an hour or whatever and wake up to the ~absence of noise~ versus some annoying alarm. It’s got other great features as well but if you’re just trying to sleep they’ve got just what you need. You get a lot more if you drop a few bucks but they don’t force you in to anything just to use the app. \n\nMy only issue is that if you have to use your phone’s speaker then it will kill your phone overnight even if it’s charging. However this is likely more an Apple problem than a developer issue (like forcing me to close the app or listen to it over carplay…) so I don’t fault them for that.",

Do you have any sleeping sound app suggestions?” And she responded “Yes, there is one called white noise and you can pick your sound to sleep too.” I searched up white noise and got this app. I was so happy because when you listen to any of the sound effects it is 8 hours long!

I really don’t care about all the new sounds they’re adding to justify the subscription model, so what would have been a five star review is now a three star review.  \n\nI’m not sure what’s up with developers moving to these subscription pricing models.

I understand needing to pay the dev team, but a sub model with a yearly fee of $40 per year is crazy to me, especially for those of us who only ever use a few sounds. Maybe there could be two sub levels—one for people who want access to all sounds, and one that gives people like 5 additional sound “unlocks”. Seems to me there are a significant number of reviewers saying the same thing. If they offered sound packs or dropped their sub price by 50%, I think they’d see a huge increase in number of subscribers which, in turn, would generate more income.",

Listening to the classical music now as I write this. I have ADD, and I have found that using this app to provide background noise or music helps me focus, and also helps my anxiety when people are making noises around me. I am still on the free trial, but I believe this app is definitely worth the $40 annual subscription. I used it to fall asleep last night, and looked forward to listening again today. 10/10, highly recommend from someone who is neurodivergent.",

Thanks to the background feature I am able to listen to various sounds/music while listening to audiobooks which helps me stay much more focused than listening the the audiobook alone. My favorite sound while listening to audiobooks is the classical music. I really wish you add more classical music and maybe even some suspension/scary music/sounds to make listening to horror audiobooks even more interesting!! \n\nI also like listening to the various sounds as a meditation when I’m on the train/bus or even studying. It helps drown out the chaotic world and have some time to just breathe and relax and think about whatever.",

I decided to start using the chat with a doctor feature as well (on my free trial now, but 100% going to pay for it when the trial is up). The first time I ever talked to a doctor, she diagnosed me correctly with an ear infection and sent me in some antibiotics that cleared it right up. The next time I used it was after I had a nasty stomach bug. It took two doctors to accurately diagnose and treat me, though. The first one told me it was heartburn (I hadn’t started my vomiting yet), then after vomiting for 12 hours, I used it again and they told me it was indeed gastroenteritis. They were more than happy to send me in some Zofran for my horrible nausea so I could go back to work. Nausea leaves me useless so I was so grateful to be able to talk to a doctor after office hours and get some relief. Also the wait time for me has always been less than 15 mins. If you’re not into prescription medications, no worries, they recommended several things I had already tried prior to prescribing me medication. Plus you must identify yourself before they give medications. Love this app & makes life so much easier. That being said, if it tells you that you have something emergent going on, go to the ER, just in case. That’s how accurate this app has been for me. Huge money & time saver.",

One night I woke up in pain from a bad tooth abscess, and it was 2 am so I knew they don’t open until 7am. Well I went on anyways just to fill out a questionnaire for an appointment for the next morning and to my surprise, a doctor instantly logged on at 2 am and helped me!!! The chat only took about 20 mins and he sent my prescription to my normal pharmacy right away. I can’t believe how amazing this program is for people like me who work daily and can’t take off work every time I have a small issue that needs a doctor. I often don’t have time to sit at urgent care for 2 hours. With this app it only takes 15-20 mins of texting and you’re good to go. Both doctors I have chatted with were wonderful.

I did not go back to sleep till after and woke up later before CVS would have my antibiotic ready as they have a better construct for letting their clients know the ETA of their script being filled.\n\nThat is my only complaint. Debra was professional and now that I finished my antibiotic I am completely healed from the UTI feeling much better. Also very thankful to be seen because no one wants this to move to their kidneys. I am keeping the app on my iPhone for now. As I am between jobs I can not presently afford to think of a monthly or annual membership, but I can see the value. With no income right now it just would not yet be logical to me. I was attended on a Sunday and this was better than the cost of an ER or urgent care in my locale.\n\nI did read other reviews, and I am assessing also the simple fact that I believe telemedicine has a role to fill.

Today, I have a severe tooth infection and I knew the quickest way I could get relief for my pain and get access to medication would be to pay for a visit on K Health. You quickly describe your symptoms, get connected with a doctor, and if your symptoms are diagnosed and you need medication it will get sent to your local pharmacy. Not only is it quick and easy to use but the doctors are very nice, knowledgeable and also give you support on additional resources. Today, I got advice on some resources I can use to get reduced or free dental services that I didn’t even know about.

Eight cavities by the age of 6 (there was a corner candy store), to braces from junior high to high school because I had a terrible overbite. For that orthodontia, they pulled 4 molars and made me wear this horrible headgear appliance wrapped around my head. None of this Invisalign or SmileDirect. Two steel pins inserted into special braces in my mouth and elastic to pull putting constant pressure to rearrange the teeth I had left. I wore that thing day and night for 3 years. And rubber bands, too. All that hardware left me with multiple abrasions that later introduced decay, and over the years I had multiple root canals, veneers and a dread of dentists.\nThen I was prescribed Synthroid for hypothyroidism, which in turn depleted bone density and probably weakened my teeth further. All this is to say that I now have teeth breaking off at the gumline and I’m waiting til there’s so little left I’ll have to get dentures. \nSo, today Dr. Baker read my profile, saw a photo of this upper molar that has an abscess and prescribed amoxicillin and a special mouthwash. I picked them up at the pharmacy a couple hours later. I haven’t seen a dentist for eight years, so getting that kind of response in person would be impossible. Believe me, this was a lifesaver!",

I have a UTI and I don’t have time to go to my doctor just to do a urine test for them to tell me something I already know. So At 6:30am central time I got the KHealth app, answered some questions about symptoms I was having, spoke with a doctor, and she confirmed that my symptoms were lined up with those of a UTI. She asked if I wanted to go for testing to get a confirmed diagnosis or if I wanted to get treatment based off of my symptoms. I told her I just wanted to get treatment as I have had UTIs in the past and I know that this is another one. Within SECONDS she sent a prescription to the closest pharmacy to me and it will be ready in time for me to get it on my way to work! If you have had a UTI before you know how painful and annoying it it so I’m at very pleased and thankful for this app and these doctors to say the least. I was so happy I started texting my boyfriend about how it was easier, faster, and even cheaper than going to my doctor and then I figured I would leave a review for people who actually need to know this information. Hope this helps!",

              "review": "I feel like this app is good to let you know if you don’t have a life threatening illness or injury. The way the app the works is that you start by telling the app about a symptom that you have (for example, a headache). The app then asks yous series of questions to narrow down your potential illness or injury and information about that injury or illness that you have. The potential illnesses that the app gives tells you you might have are based on percentages of other people’s questionnaire. For example, if you initially put in “headache” as your first symptom. The app will ask you a series of other related questions , such as “how you had any vomiting?” or “where is the headache mostly focused?” The app then tells you a list of illnesses or injuries and the percentage each illness or injury. E.g. “80% of the people that had similar answers to yours had a migraine. 40% had something else.” Etc... However, I noticed that the app doesn’t delete your past survey/questionnaires so it will ask you how your doing after you brought up a symptom to the app. I’ve been getting scam calls for the past few weeks and I haven’t been answering them.  But when I decided that I would answer one, a telemarketer confirmed my name and address and advertised me a product that had to do with a past symptom that I asked the app. I made the connection and then deleted my past symptoms from the app.",

At first it was easy, I had already been on a prescription for years and this was better than having to go into the office when refill time comes around. That was until the app started getting buggy and I could request a dr but the app would never actually assign me one which meat no refill when needed. I decided to go back to seeing a doctor in person after the 4th or 5th time this happened. After some time, I decided to try again but this time I wanted to give the primary care section of the app a try. I had my appointment, everything went great….until I was charged $150 a month later after already paying for the appointment. Apparently I had somehow enrolled in their primary care membership which is separate from the mental health service and cost 3x more. I immediately canceled the membership and reached out moments after they charged me to see if a refund would be possible to which they replied with “we can’t offer a refund at this time”.  I then explained that I’m aware the fault is on me for not realizing the primary care visit was different than mental health but I felt that the app had been very misleading…no response. There is some good to this app if you don’t have insurance but the trouble is not worth it if you do, just go to a doctor.",

It hindered the first few days of my vacation: I couldn’t talk, swallow/drink, eat, or touch my ear without the sharp, stabbing pains. This is when I finally decided to get it checked out at the AdventHealth Walk-in clinic. I walked in to be greeted by an expressionless and unsympathetic toned receptionist who rudely told me that I had to wait 4 hours. There was no way I could go another 30 minutes with the pain. I decided to go online to find a telehealth provider, and I found K Health. I can’t begin to tell you how amazing this app is. It asked me specific and relevant questions and I was connected with a doctor within 10 minutes who further asked me questions. The doctor prescribed me my preferred medicine and was incredibly friendly, nonjudgmental, and quick. My ear pain was gone within the next 48 hours. Never have I ever felt so strongly about an app to write a review. Thanks so much K Health and its health care professionals for making it possible for people without insurance to seek and have access to affordable and quick health care (especially an ear infection!) Such a life saver. :)",

This physician does not listen to the patient and she did not offer or give me a listing of places to go to be treated instead told me to try messy suppositories (prefer the pill instead). Then told me they wouldn’t be able to treat me for v. issues ever again, so there you have it ladies you’d think this physician would understand the situation being a woman herself. The last time I signed in (my first time using the app) I was treated for something different not a recurring yeast infection. Ladies just beware of the treatment you will not get from this stupid physician. Yeast and bacterial are two different infections they are not the same and are common in women. I think instead of having a Family Practice doctor give medication out for gynecological issues a gynecologist should be giving out the medication and feedback not a Family Practice doctor giving you her own back and forth reasoning for using creams instead of a pill. Why pay for the medical treatment if it’s not going to be given??? Sorry Dr. Rose…I know it’s not what you wanted to hear (as she told me in her rant about being Diflucan resistant) but you’re not that great of a physician and you don’t know my medical history and what treatment I’ve ever used.

I had a monthly membership with Khealth and wanted to use this as my primary source of medical attention. \nI got the help I needed instantly with a 2-3 hour wait time for any medication at the pharmacy.  \nRecently I had longer wait times to connect with a doctor.  The use of users had skyrocketed on this app.  What made me leave is now their outrageous cost of a membership…. What used to be about $20 a month is now $50… I’ve had 1am or 3am visits bc I needed medical attention fast.  By the time I woke up my medicine was ready and they got me to feeling better and back on my feet in no time.

It was 10:00pm when I realized I definitely have a UTI and am going to need antibiotics and this literally saved me the stress of having to go all night in pain and then sit at the walk-in clinic tomorrow waiting in pain just to wait even longer for my prescription to be called in and prepared. Now I can just go first thing in the morning to pick up my medicine and start feeling better much sooner than if I were to wait to see a doctor tomorrow.

The woman tells me, “We aren’t sure if we’re going to send out notifications or not yet.” Ummm…. So you’re just gonna wait until someone needs it for their child to find out the hard way?!!! Wow! THEN, I was told after I did 3 one month check ins with my prescription, I’d get moved to 90 day scripts so I could check in every 3 months. That happened ONE time before this next provider had a conniption that my pharmacy filled as one month script with 2 refills instead of 90 pills in one bottle. Idk lady?! That’s how they filled it and that’s how I picked it up each time! So, I guess she decided to be spiteful and switched me back to 30 day check ins with NO refills even though I’m having ZERO issues with my prescription!!!

(Warning: graphic) I had strep throat with white-speckled and swollen tonsils—for a good doctor, this is an easy diagnosis and an easy treatment with antibiotics. But the doctor I got claimed my throat just “looked a little red” in the pictures I sent, and essentially recommended drinking water and trying throat lozenges, and maybe taking ibuprofen as well. When I pressed him, it was clear he didn’t actually read over the symptoms I had, which is basically his only job.\n\nThis is the second experience I’ve had paying 30$ to K health for them to recommend “getting sleep and if you don’t get better, go see a real doctor”—aka we can’t help you, but we’ll gladly still take your money. I’m not impressed with them printing off the home-remedies for sore throats off of Google. The company says they’ll get any lab tests that are needed, but I guess that wasn’t true. Its on me to make a separate appointment with a real doctor in my town (what I was originally trying to avoid) and get a strep test through them. I guess Khealth makes more money by just brushing you off, saying “you’ll be fine, get some rest.” Then if you press them they recommend visiting with an actual doctor. Ridiculous.

What was a problem was the inconsistent care. I’m a Respiratory therapist and know the difference between a URI and a sinus infection. I used the provider and it went fine, diagnosed with a sinus infection got antibiotics(back story, our two sons also had sinus infections and were antibiotics). It went great for me so I sent my husband the referral so his visit was FREE, but I would have rather paid then get the treatment recommended to him. Our household of 4 have all been diagnosed with sinus infections(2 kids in person with pediatricians) and me via the K app. My husband in turn got a RUDE provider that insisted she had concerns for Covid or maybe it was a URI. There was nothing indicating COVID, no exposure, he is fully vaccinated. Our sons tested negative etc. Not sure why she was so concerned, needless to say she did not help at all. We will use Teladoc instead from now on. I don’t know how any clearer a patients symptoms have to be represented to get treatment for something that is clear as day.",

              "review": "So I know $23 isn’t much but when you’re on a tight budget with 6 kids, you’re a stay at home\nmom who homeschools, and have a hard working husband, it does seem like a lot when it’s wasted. \n\nThe primary care doctor can’t see me until February. So I tried K. I know I have a UTI. I haven’t had one in many years but almost every woman knows if they have one. I have the classic symptoms that haven’t gone away in 10 days after home remedies. But the sweet doctor on the app asked me if there was a possibility I was pregnant. I said yes because I’m an honest person (even though if I WAS it was too early to tell on a test) and she immediately thought I was possibly having a miscarriage and I need to see a doc in person. I told her I have had 4 miscarriages before and I know if it was that and it’s for sure not. She insisted she was limited in her helping me and to go see a physician. I pretty much begged her to please send a prescription to CVS and she said sorry she wants me to go see a doctor in person 😭 I sound dramatic but I just was disappointed that I didn’t  feel heard after I said I “could” be pregnant. I know she was doing her job and she seemed nice so that’s why I gave 2 stars. Hope this review helps someone!",

              "review": "I have a painful tooth infection. Had the same thing three years before but on a different tooth. Standard course of action most dentists take is to prescribe an antibiotic and if that doesn’t resolve it then root canal next. Last time I had it with a different tooth the antibiotic did the trick and it’s been 3 years. So after a good hour of the robot diagnoses and taking pictures of my ID and all the text codes being sent and the most overly comprehensive set up. I waited about 45 minutes.  I was assigned a cardiologist. Really for a tooth ache. Well I thought no worries this is a very simple diagnosis. Then was told he needed picture of red swollen gums before they could prescribe anything. What a bacterial root infection doesn’t necessarily cause red swollen gums. So he said sorry no evidence no prescription go see the dentist. And then said what am I supposed to take your word for it?  Ah yes doctor that is what you are supposed to do. What do you think I spent $23 to scam you out of $5 worth of antibiotics?  This wasn’t like I was trying to get some kind of prescription narcotics or something.   Complete waste of time. If you can get an antibiotic prescribed for a toothache theres not a whole lot they can do for you. I wonder if I called them about a heart problem if they would assign me a dentist?",

That meant, I had to pay full price for my medication. If I had to buy the medication without single care, it would have cost me more than what I earn every month. Single care absolutely saved my life. I could not have survived, without single care. The price of my medication was astronomical. I stopped taking 1/2 of the medication prescribed to me. Why? I could not afford them. It was terrible. Fortunately, I found a Single Care advertisement ,in the waiting rooms of one of my Dr’s. I had very low expectations when I signed up. I figured, this is a free service, there must be a catch!! Was I 100% wrong. The amount of money I save/saved using Single Care is incredible. I can’t thank Single Care enough for making it possible for me to get ALL my prescriptions! It’s free to join , I hope you give them a try. Seriously, it’s a fantastic company and it doesn’t cost anything to join. Give it a try, you will be very happy you did!!!!",

I have sometimes had to go back to my Doctor to request a less expensive option. Other times I just decided not to bother filling the Rx. SingleCare has changed that! I was able to look up my medications on the SingleCare App and actually get a list of all the local Pharmacies sorted by the lowest price first using the special SingleCare negotiated pricing. Then I simply select the pharmacy I want to go to for my Rx, which reveals a special coupon I use at the pharmacy to get the amazing low price! I can't believe this program is free and anyone can use it! I tell everyone about it. With the exception of one or two genetic medications I was already filling for a good price, now I don't even bother to use my Express Scripts Rx Benefit. I go right to the SingleCare App for incredible savings! Thank you!",

Insurance companies do not care if people suffer because they are based on the concept that the patient will not be sick and therefore they will not have to pay for medical care.  When someone is sick, the insurance companies fight to not pay for medical care that doctors feel is best for their patients to be able to live. \n\nSingleCare is one of a few companies that I have found that have been successful at helping patients afford the medications they are prescribed with or without insurance. \n I do not know how they operate but I have insurance and some of my medications are not covered or have horrible copays.  High copays are another way insurance companies are trying to manipulate us.   I have been very sick for years and one month between jobs, I had no insurance.

Then I tried a Canadian pharmacy and that was close to $300. This service has it for $160 at Ralph’s. When I went to buy it, I fully expected to be told that it wasn’t available at that price, but it was and they were so kind. Just a side note, Ralph’s pharmacy does show up frequently as the cheapest option in this app so I’m becoming very fond of that store and this app.",

I found that odd as I have used Good RX for 30+ prescriptions for myself, my children, even for my mother, and the price always matched.  I called Single Care Rx to find out what the discrepancy was, as I could find no answer on the website or in the app.  The CSR told me the price should be $44, but an individual pharmacist (not the pharmacy itself), can adjust pricing as they see fit on any controlled substance.  How in the world is that legal?  There are set prices for goods, or should be.  I had no idea that pharmacies could increase the prices of medications just because they feel like it.  Back to Good RX for me.  They have always given me exact pricing, to the penny, and no pharmacy has ever increased the price on any medication, including controlled substances.  I find this to be deceiving, and quite frankly, alarming.  Not only will I not use Single Care Rx again, I’ve moved all my family’s prescriptions out of Walgreens as well, and they will receive the same review.",

Because lately it seems like even with apps like Single Care and GoodRX, prescription prices are changing every single month. I had one RX that was over $350 for no reason (it’s not a new script or anything and it IS a generic, not like it’s a new name brand one), and with using GoodRX, which has always helped me GREATLY, it was STILL over $67! And I don’t know about you? But $67 on ONE medication for ONE month? Is INSANE. I don’t have that. So I DLed Single Care again, to compare prices. Suddenly, that EXACT same RX, magically became $19. And at the same pharmacy too. So make sure you DL Single Care too. If for nothing else, to just COMPARE the cost of RXs and make sure you’re getting THEE ABSOLUTE rock-bottom price!!",

It would be nice if they would add on the coupons that the drug reps leave at the office for patients since some pts are still virtual or have a hard time getting around and don’t have help! It would cut down the amount of elderly that end up in the ER because they ran out of their med or couldn’t afford it that month. For example a pt with CHF and is instructed to take lasix twice a day and doesn’t have any for a couple days. That pt has to call 911 because they are coughing or can’t breath because they have too much fluid built up in their lungs. We all need to help for continuity of care!",

There is absolutely nothing worse than having to Google “doctors near me” and having to call each individual one to find out who can or has time to see you immediately! Oh, and if you don’t make an appointment with each one at the very moment, by the time you call back bc you wasted all that time calling every single doctor, just to realize that one was the soonest appointment and doctor available even though they are booked 3 weeks out at the moment, then by the time you call back to schedule that appointment, it’s already been taken!!! So now you have to wait 4 weeks to be seen!\nSo, basically, like I’ve said, this is an absolutely great app for SO many reason other than just what I’ve mentioned. I recommend this app to everyone I know for it’s easy convenience! Also nice that I don’t have to deal with calling and as soon as someone answers the phone, I’m not being thrown on hold before I’m even given the chance to answer them back as to if, “it’s okay to hold!” \nSo take it from me, this is a MUST HAVE app!!!",

So why was the list showing me doctors for all 50 states in the country when I had already put in my address?!!!! So I had to cancel the appointment with that doctor and then find a doctor that was both in my insurance and in the state of Connecticut from this big long list of providers from all insurance plans all over the country\n\nI finally found a doctor and booked an appointment. A few hours before the appointment, his billing department calls me looking for “more information”, but my phone showed that their phone number is located out of Texas!! What kind of doctor operates in Connecticut and has a billing department in Texas?! At this point, I was beginning to doubt the safety of this site when it comes to my personal information and I already gave them copies of my insurance card!!!!!

Patients who needed to see a doctor could always find someone and pay a reasonable fee if no insurance and expect to use most insurances including Medi-Cal and HMO. If they wanted to schedule with same doctor for follow up, this option was always available. Since June of 2022, the billing structure has changed. The doctor has to pay $40 for each patient who books online, whether the patient is seen or not. This, of course, became a much more expensive proposition for the doctor and he has option to cap his monthly expense, which makes him unavailable to receive any future referrals after he reaches the cap. The new billing structure placed a huge barrier to patient-doctor interaction on Zocdoc. Firstly, the doctor can’t afford to accept Medi-Cal or HMO patients anymore. Secondly, to cover increased expenses, the doctor must increase his charges for patients coming from zocdoc. Thirdly, the moment the doctor reaches his cap he becomes unavailable to more patients on zocdoc. Therefore, the choice of doctors, obviously, diminishes drastically. My advice, find a different service to look for doctors, just do a simple Google search. Zocdoc isn’t worth it.\n\nDeveloper responded with a lame robotic answer, not covering a single issue raised by my review, just call us if you have questions…yeah right.",

About 85% of the time through my experience, upon following up either the provider isn’t actually in-network despite it saying that they are in ZocDoc or more commonly the appointment I thought I scheduled isn’t actually available (and sometimes they aren’t available for months). When I callout the provider’s rep about this issue they seem like they have no idea why I’m frustrated and offer zero sympathy… and sometimes they get mad at me for explaining my frustration… this is usually after spending 10 - 15 minutes spelling out all the personal info that should have been provided by ZocDoc. Medical care should be more delicately handled vs victimizing patients (I know this seems dramatic but when dealing with certain medical conditions and then needing to deal with this mess - it really does feel violating). I love ZocDoc’s interface, all the info it provides, reviews, and such ease of use. Unfortunately providers seem to have difficulty syncing their system… and show no cares in the world about the inconvenience and confusion it causes. I think it used to be better. I’ll probably just use my insurance website, moving forward… even though it’s horrible… and just call providers directly vs attempting to schedule online.",

I love the fact that I can get on ZocDoc when I need to and find a doctor in my area fairly easily.  For the most part the system works.  However, I think the relationship ZocDoc has with its doctors needs help as I have been told more than once that the doctors don’t work with ZocDoc even though they are listed on the ZocDoc app.  I have had appointments that I’ve booked through the app cancelled hours and days later for seemingly no reason.  When contacting the doctors offices directly (mostly to find out why the appointment was cancelled) I’ve been told that they don’t work with ZocDoc.  In three cases, two of them I was able to rebook my appointment directly with the doctors office.  In one case, I wasn’t able to book because the ZocDoc booking was canceled just days before the actual appointment.  All of these situations were frustrating to say the least.  However, I will give ZocDoc credit for creating a space where I can even find a doctor, which is way better than what my insurance company offers.",

It was easy to book through the app - I didn’t have to call or go to another website. I’ve tried searching for a pcp multiple times throughout the past year and when searching through my insurance portal or other search engines they would say the provider accepted new patients but when I called they actually weren’t still accepting new ones or the next available appointment was months away. After trying and failing to find one, I would just give up for a couple months then try again. I randomly heard about zocdoc when listening to a podcast (shoutout crime junkie) and I thought I’d give it a shot. I found a pcp and had an appointment booked for the next day. I’m honestly so surprised that it was so easy. I’d recommend to anyone.",

ZocDoc is great especially for PPO patients who don’t know where to start when I’m recommending they follow up with a specialist. \nI find that so many people don’t understand their in network benefits - granted, I barely do myself and everyone’s is so nuanced. \nUnfortunately, if you have an HMO, subsidized medical coverage (such as Medi-caid) or Kaiser, your options will be at the mercy of your insurance designated plan. But for those with PPO plans, ZocDoc is wonderful. I tell my patients it’s Yelp and OpenTable for medical providers. \n\nSome tips, remember, to make sure you’ve filtered for the actual specialist you’re trying to find. For example, some patients that type in “eczema” or “warts” when they’re trying to book with a dermatologist or “ingrown toe nail” trying to book a podiatrist will end up finding the urgent care. Sure, urgent care providers like me can tell you want to do but usually I’m sure you wanted to see the dermatologist or actual podiatrist.",

Uploading your insurance card info is also very easy…just scan a pic on your phone. Just be sure to double check the info because I’ve done this with 3 different insurances and one of them was incorrect. However, they have an easy process to change it to the correct one. Best of all, once you do it, you don’t need to input your info again! I also love that it not only tells me who’s in my network, it also tells me significant info like distance from me, availability, a short bio of the dr, plus reviews! And, you can even see who’s available out of network, so if you have out of network benefits, you can see whomever you please! Seriously, one of the best health apps out there!",

I’ve been to a orthopedist who erroneously diagnosed me with athletes foot and a bone spur. A dermatologist who postponed the meeting 15 minutes before it starting then wasn’t able to authorize my prescriptions with insurance. Another dermatologist who tried to sell me an egregiously expensive product and then wouldn’t refill the prescriptions I’ve used for years. A primary care physician where a later doctor described her care as “there to get you out the door and irresponsible.” The app shows drs drowning in positive reviews and seems to aggressively bubble compliments to the top. Drs can cancel with almost no notice and way too many agree to treat you online for conditions that they definitely should ask you to come in for. For all its glitz and polish, zocdoc pushes a last minute “in and out” approach to doctors that results in inferior care with professionals who are not significantly vetted or held accountable. Just call a dr to get quality care and never use this app - it is not worth it.",

This is the second time I’ve made the appointments and waited a half hour the morning of, only to get no messages about getting a link to the video calls (also specified under my appointment information). This is the second time my appointment has been cancelled without warning with no response without building the strength to reach out. \nThis makes me realize why people don’t reach out for help.

With that being said, I don’t love the fact that you can’t tell which doctors will charge you what amount, which ones are ACTUALLY for your insurance and the rescheduling of appointments without your notice. \n\nI came to this app to ease the trouble of calling every doctor and setting up appointments. It’s frightening enough meeting a doctor for the first time and...they’re terrible. They make you feel uncomfortable, insult you indirectly and/or their staff makes the entire experience even worse. What I got was exactly what I asked for. Easy to use, easy to review but there are still flaws. \n\nI’ve had difficulty finding ones that take my insurance and then the issue of copay. You honestly never know what to expect. I’ve had them call me only to find out what I’m paying AFTER the entire session. For some it’s $15, others $30 and it can go upwards of $300. \n\nThe other issue is the rescheduling. I had one doctor completely inconvenience me by changing my appointment. That inconvenience led me to working on a day I usually had off and I ended up with a severe cold, forcing me to cancel majority of my other appointments. \n\nIn the end, it’s what you make of it.

It is an easy app to use, but when I am searching for a specialist or a primary care provider it displays options that are at least 30-40 minutes away. If I filter my results to a specific day, it displays (non sponsored) doctors who are in the NYC area when there are definitely a few closer doctors available. This could be a glitch but I was able to work through it and found an available doctor who fit my schedule. My only concern is that this app will always be more convenient for individuals in densely populated areas. I live in a big college town in NJ and I was still unable to find a doctor that was less than a 20 minute drive away. Again, it is a VERY convenient app to use especially if you are on the go but there needs to be a significant user increase in order for everyone to benefit from Zocdoc.",

After booking, the doctors office calls and let me know they are do not practice in the area I was looking for and said they get that a lot as ZocDoc has the wrong info. I gave ZocDoc another try and booked an appointment time with a 2nd doctor and the doctors office later called and said that time was not available and I would need to rescheduled. Their next appointment was two months out. Was getting frustrated but was about to try for my third and final time but something told me to look at the doctors reviews. Turns out someone with the same insurance as me booked them and after going through the appointment the doctors office told them they actually didn’t take the insurance. This app is full of incorrect information, didn’t save me time, and still had to call the doctors office so was not as easy as they make it seem in the commercial. At least that has been in my experience.",

Once I can finally stay in the app, once I click “find a provider” it takes me to an cute error message, telling me “youre in the waiting room! The service is not available at this time!” Are you f’ing joking? Finally went through the rigamarole of finding my actual insurance provider, and got a tele health appointment set up with a geriatric physician, who provided no information that I didn’t already know. Finally got logged in to my actual HI provider, and all the offices they recommended were hundreds of miles away. All I want to do, here in 2021, is find an actual doctor, with an office near my home, that is covered by my insurance company. Everything this app does seems designed to keep me from doing that. Long story short, hopefully no one who tries to use this app is actually sick, because if you use this app/company, you are going to die before you find a doctor.",

They have made my medical visits a nightmare by constantly emailing/mailing/calling to say services aren’t covered that I didn’t realize the facility wasn’t obtaining authorization on or I have already gone out of my way to obtain prior authorization on. I emailed every test Mayo Clinic would be doing and already got my max out of pocket so they decided to penalize me for the facility not obtaining the prior authorization. I’ve been penalized $300 three times this year so far. Two MRIs were STAT THAT Mayo Clinic ordered for same or next day to decide if I had a leaking reconstructive implant after bilateral mastectomies, rule out a tumor on my heart that would have necessitated open heart surgery and the last thing I was penalized for was an ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy of my thyroid to decide if I had thyroid cancer(which I emailed MyQHealth and told them I would need 2 months advance notice)!

Additionally, doing a regular task like pulling up an EOB doesn’t allow you to export it to another app like Files, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. - a very common workflow for someone who keeps track of EOBs - even though it is clearly pulled up in PDF form in a ‘new’ window. I normally would try to do these things using a browser like Chrome, however the links to subpages aren’t even clickable using a mobile browser. I am forced to copy and paste the link.

When I open the app it shows me the home page for about 2-3 seconds and the. The whole app just shuts down and disappears so that I am back on MY phone’s home page. It has never worked good for me.  Before the update, I could sometimes (about 40% of the time) get on and try to find the information I needed but now I can’t get on at all.  :/  \n\nPS-I have an iPhone 11 with up to date iOS software (14.4)",

To endanger lives to sell a $7 app is absolutely reprehensible and I hope that the authorities provide you with a more concrete demonstration of the consequences of your vile actions.\n\nTo all those who have seen these ads, I encourage you to report it as well.

My favorite thing right now is writing things I m grateful for and doing breathing exercises, but probably the best part of this app is that there is so much you can do so my practice can evolve to fit my needs. My one suggestion is I wish I could write a free form sentence or couple of words in the mood check-ins instead of having to quantify my mood on a scale (or at least make this an option or setting). The reason is that quantifying my mood actually stresses me out because there is an implicit judgement that a higher ranked mood is better than one with a lower number, so I feel unhappy about my mood if it isn t high which creates a bit of a negative feedback loop. In general there is research that shows that trying to be happy in this way is counterproductive, which I think is what I am experiencing. Instead, I think reflecting Overall I am so grateful for this app and the hard work of the developers! You have made my life significantly better :)"

Getting to see my finch grow and Learn about themselves is so much fun and makes me excited to check in every day and send my finch out on an adventure. I love being able to choose my little ones colors, and outfits, and decorate their home, which keeps me motivated to complete task and earn rainbow stones to buy more stuff! If you need a friend to get you through and keep you motivated then I 100% recommend Finch! Plus the 2 seasonal events I ve gotten to participate in so far have been so cute and fun. Ps: There is a free and paid version and the free version is 100% functional and add free. You really only miss out on a few features but nothing that ruins the app not to have. The paid version opens up the remaining features like various reflections and quizzes and stuff. I had Finch for 1 month before I paid for a year because I love it so much ($40 I think for a year can t remember). Coming from someone who never leaves reviews on ANYTHING this app is worth the time and if you choose to pay it s worth the money.

However, I find that the current goals system limits how meaningfully I can track my progress over time. For example, I d love the option to complete a goal early rather than waiting until the set date, as well as a way to click on a goal and view my consistency over time. For goals like going to the gym four times a week, daily reminders can be overwhelming, even with snooze options, as it s hard to rearrange flexibly. Being a Type A person, I m motivated to analyze my data for self-improvement. However, the structure currently incentivizes completing smaller, less meaningful tasks just to level up, rather than focusing on goals that are truly important to me. Whether I complete five quick tasks or aim for eighteen ambitious ones, the rewards are the same, making it feel like there s less value in tackling long-term goals. While the app is visually engaging and light-hearted, some of my goals like health are lifelong commitments. They re serious, and I d love the app to reflect that by offering more nuanced ways to track and celebrate real progress. If Finch could add more flexibility and recognition for high-impact goals, it would create an ideal balance between playfulness and depth for users who want to see more than just their birb level up."

I don t have them all, but adding more and more as the events go on would make app more engaging (at least, for me). One suggestion would be a chinchilla, if there isn t already ones. Chinchillas are super soft and cuddly and would make an amazing addition for a birb pet!! Additionally, I m someone who uses he/they pronouns, and I think it would be so cool if you could have the option to use multiple pronouns for my birb, such as: he/she, they/he, she/they, etc. !

I could barely work or pay my bills, much less do dishes, shower, or take care of myself.

I consistently use the first aid and soundscapes during panic attacks, and the journal prompts have come up many times during therapy.

At this point, to be pushed Ozempic, is SO inconsiderate and dangerous for those that aren t doing well in their own recovery journeys. Not only should Ozempic quit being pushed for weight loss, but to blindly push this towards a client base that overwhelmingly struggles with many kinds of disorders comes off as incredibly predatory. To have the kind of money this business has, and not be able to turn off or hide weight loss drugs from their clients seems like a massive oversight.

I moved away from my hometown and my psychiatrist couldn t prescribe my meds if I lived in a different state than where she is licensed. So it was very convenient for me to hop on HERS and get a prescription very quickly without all the bells and whistles as when I went the traditional route, it took almost 2 months for my doctor to diagnose me and write a prescription. With that being said, after 2 months, I was very informed about the drug I was being prescribed and was confident that it would work because my doctor took the time to get to know me and listen to what I needed. So I m not sure how this App can just issue psychiatric medication to ppl who ve never been assessed by a professional in depth and may have no experience with these types of drugs. In a nutshell, it was great for me because I know what I m getting into and pretty much just needed a refill but to someone who s completely new to medication, it runs the risk of being a little sketchy."

You have the opportunity to mark-off which ones have been paid to assist the insurer to track whether my deductible has been reached. The app also allows you to quickly check which providers are in-network. Prescriptions on OptumRx are managed on a separate app. You can also save the contacts of my regular doctors for easy reference. It will also prompt you to look after my health by getting my blood pressure taken, getting a lipid panel or getting a flu shot. However, you do not put anything personal into the app. It does not collect my health data, so that s good from a privacy perspective, but if that s what you re looking for, you ll need another app."

Due to some error with me having two different insurance policies I wasn t actually able to log in to my account for months after the update. Even more frustrating was before the update, their behavioral health section was actually much easier to navigate and more robust then my previous insurance, Anthems. Now they ve changed the way BH is organized and you can no longer search by profession only the vague BH issues anxiety, family issues and substance abuse (you can do a blanket search for any profession but the app crashes so much when I try this it might as well not be an option). This leads to not being able to find therapists, psychologists or psychiatrists who are covered. They seem to list nurse practitioners first and foremost, and while they can be great for medication management they are not a one to one replacement for all mental health services . Even more frustrating they removed all crisis information, beyond a number, such as in patient facilities so good luck if you or my loved one has one."

If you pay on the app and remember later that it was something you had already paid, it will be almost impossible to get the correction made. No only will you need to remember which copays you mistakenly paid, but UHC uses different 3rd party processing companies and you would have to go through a lot of stress and frustration to get to the correct one, only to hope that their customer service is competent enough to help you.

Getting up and walking so many steps in a few minutes several times a day, walking over 10k daily and walking quickly 30 minutes a day. That is really encouraging people to move more. Now with rewards you get a little $ for 5k and a little more for 10k. That s it as far as physical activity. Instead you get money from attaching my device and filling out a health survey, which requires no effort other than tapping a screen and is just a way for the insurance company to get information about people s health, probably for future insurance limitations. The reward program certainly doesn t encourage anyone to be more physically active, 5-10k is minimal and doesn t require the effort of moving multiple times a day or walking quickly. Looks like it is more about insurance information gathering than really encouraging healthy habits. Just very disappointing. Also, it is not syncing well."

Why are we offered an appointment if we are not being seen in under an hour? This is really poor service and should be noted on the website that they are not seeing patients according to check in and appointments rather how the provider prefers. People are sick. People are waiting to get in. Patients are following procedures but providers are not? I was told this rotation of how patients are being seen was new to staff as well and changed up in the middle of the day?! Ridiculous!! Especially after the price we pay for the service and spend about 5 mins with the provider! This needs assessed."

The app sends appointment confirmation number - which you need for my test - through a website and not by email or text, so you better take a screenshot of my confirmation number or it will be lost if you need to retrieve it later.

One of the standout features is the symptom checker, which provides quick and reliable information about common childhood illnesses.

Additionally, the app offers helpful reminders for vaccinations and check-ups, ensuring that I never miss an important appointment. I also love the educational resources available in the app. The articles and tips on child health and wellness are insightful and written in a way that s easy to understand. The community support feature is another highlight. Being able to connect with other parents and share experiences has been invaluable.

So I used this feature and it gave me conflicting advice that was wrong in both cases. 1st it said I over watered, I had not watered in 5 days. Next it said it didn t get enough sun light. The only way for it to get more sunlight is if the days themselves where longer. I m saying it gets direct sunlight from sun up to sun down. With that said I can t honestly say the main feature is worth posting for.

This thing helps me fall sleep so fast even when I feel wide awake. I found a second unexpected use. I have the hardest time focusing when I m studying I would say I have ADHD tendencies.(never been diagnosed so I don t claim to have ADHD.) but this gives my brain something to think about without it being distracting to the point I can t take in or retain the information I m reading. The third use I found list this is it helps a lot with my anxiety. I ll just play whatever is calming to me and I helped to bring down my stress and anxiety to a manageable level. I NEVER pay for subscriptions or apps being, I don t have the disposable funds to do so, but this app 100% would. For a yearly subscription it s only like $3.50 a month. It s so worth it to get all of the sounds, and even further customization, so you can create all kinds of mixes."

I didn t have a white noise machine so I looked and found the app. I was super impressed and I am very impressed that you can make combos of all of my favorite noises. I always get stressed especially with my cousins wedding coming up and whenever that happens I just listen to the bird noises it offers. It s so amazing! I go to Disney a lot and haven t found the right thing to help me fall asleep because the neighbors next to my Disney room are always wild when they come back from the parks. I ve finally found the right tool to help me go to sleep. At Disney, this helps me get a good night sleep and the best morning the next day. I m always ready for the day and I love it so much. If you are a Disney lover and you know how much my neighbors are next to my Disney room are so loud after coming back from all the parks, definitely get this app. This is a must! Definitely get this app if you have trouble sleeping!"

Even with the oscillator option off there's been times when while I'm asleep there's a sudden clap of thunder or crash of a wave that wakes me up..The piano songs are all so creepy, and the baby songs are one note types of songs not like symphonies. They get annoying quickly. The fireplace one sounds like a house burning down..not like a soft familiar crinkling you are familiar with. and idk who can sleep to the Shush option and the howling wind tunnel option..that's very very creepy.but I like creepy. Sometimes. I'm on the premium and sometimes it takes days to load the sounds. I'm glad they made the price more affordable and annual instead of a monthly thing like the trash apps out there have. Bottom line: good for conducting seances when you need some unsettling ambiance, not so much for sleep perhaps. Maybe if more soothing sounds were implemented or maybe redone recordings and the oscillation effects to stop.always open to hear new sounds though. I don't plan on getting off premium, but I also don't think these sounds will help me sleep very much at night.I just find it funny how they managed to take all the sounds that kept me wide awake at night and out them in a sleeping app.too funny.."

You can also set a timer to have it stop playing when you want, so if say you just want to take a nap on a Sunday afternoon you can set it for an hour or whatever and wake up to the ~absence of noise~ versus some annoying alarm. It s got other great features as well but if you re just trying to sleep they ve got just what you need. You get a lot more if you drop a few bucks but they don t force you in to anything just to use the app. My only issue is that if you have to use my phone s speaker then it will kill my phone overnight even if it s charging. However this is likely more an Apple problem than a developer issue (like forcing me to close the app or listen to it over carplay ) so I don t fault them for that."

I really don t care about all the new sounds they re adding to justify the subscription model, so what would have been a five star review is now a three star review. I m not sure what s up with developers moving to these subscription pricing models. The last thing I need is another subscription, especially on something I thought I had already paid for.

Our 6 week old enjoys the clothes dryer as it mimics the sound of the ventilator he was on while in the NICU for the first 4 weeks of his life.

I understand needing to pay the dev but a sub model with a yearly fee of $40 per year is crazy to me, especially for those of us who only ever use a few sounds. Maybe there could be two sub levels one for people who want access to all sounds, and one that gives people like 5 additional sound unlocks . Seems to me there are a significant number of reviewers saying the same thing. If they offered sound packs or dropped their sub price by 50%, I think they d see a huge increase in number of subscribers which, in turn, would generate more income."

Two steel pins inserted into special braces in my mouth and elastic to pull putting constant pressure to rearrange the teeth I had left. I wore that thing day and night for 3 years. And rubber bands, too. All that hardware left me with multiple abrasions that later introduced decay, and over the years I had multiple root canals, veneers and a dread of dentists. Then I was prescribed Synthroid for hypothyroidism, which in turn depleted bone density and probably weakened my teeth further. All this is to say that I now have teeth breaking off at the gumline and I m waiting til there s so little left I ll have to get dentures. So, today Dr. Baker read my profile, saw a photo of this upper molar that has an abscess and prescribed amoxicillin and a special mouthwash. I picked them up at the pharmacy a couple hours later.

Why pay for the medical treatment if it s not going to be given?

Now I know why. You have to text a lot versus a quick 5 min convo via FaceTime with the docs. You are also seeing NP s versus Dr s. This wasn t a problem for me some are smarter then docs. What was a problem was the inconsistent care. I m a Respiratory therapist and know the difference between a URI and a sinus infection. I used the provider and it went fine, diagnosed with a sinus infection got antibiotics(back story, our two sons also had sinus infections and were antibiotics). It went great for me so I sent my husband the referral so his visit was FREE, but I would have rather paid then get the treatment recommended to him. Our household of 4 have all been diagnosed with sinus infections(2 kids in person with pediatricians) and me via the K app. My husband in turn got a RUDE provider that insisted she had concerns for Covid or maybe it was a URI. There was nothing indicating COVID, no exposure, he is fully vaccinated. Our sons tested negative etc. Not sure why she was so concerned, needless to say she did not help at all. We will use Teladoc instead from now on. I don t know how any clearer a patients symptoms have to be represented to get treatment for something that is clear as day."

Standard course of action most dentists take is to prescribe an antibiotic and if that doesn t resolve it then root canal next. Last time I had it with a different tooth the antibiotic did the trick and it s been 3 years. So after a good hour of the robot diagnoses and taking pictures of my ID and all the text codes being sent and the most overly comprehensive set up. I waited about 45 minutes. I was assigned a cardiologist. Really for a tooth ache. Well I thought no worries this is a very simple diagnosis. Then was told he needed picture of red swollen gums before they could prescribe anything. What a bacterial root infection doesn t necessarily cause red swollen gums. So he said sorry no evidence no prescription go see the dentist. And then said what am I supposed to take my word for it? Ah yes doctor that is what you are supposed to do. What do you think I spent $23 to scam you out of $5 worth of antibiotics? This wasn t like I was trying to get some kind of prescription narcotics or something. Complete waste of time. If you can get an antibiotic prescribed for a toothache theres not a whole lot they can do for you. I wonder if I called them about a heart problem if they would assign me a dentist?"

Single care absolutely saved my life. I could not have survived, without single care. The price of my medication was astronomical. I stopped taking 1/2 of the medication prescribed to me. Why? I could not afford them. It was terrible. Fortunately, I found a Single Care advertisement ,in the waiting rooms of one of my Dr s. I had very low expectations when I signed up. I figured, this is a free service, there must be a catch!! Was I 100% wrong. The amount of money I save/saved using Single Care is incredible. I can t thank Single Care enough for making it possible for me to get ALL my prescriptions! It s free to join , I hope you give them a try.

When someone is sick, the insurance companies fight to not pay for medical care that doctors feel is best for their patients to be able to live. SingleCare is one of a few companies that I have found that have been successful at helping patients afford the medications they are prescribed with or without insurance. I do not know how they operate but I have insurance and some of my medications are not covered or have horrible copays. High copays are another way insurance companies are trying to manipulate us.

I called Single Care Rx to find out what the discrepancy was, as I could find no answer on the website or in the app. The CSR told me the price should be $44, but an individual pharmacist (not the pharmacy itself), can adjust pricing as they see fit on any controlled substance. How in the world is that legal? There are set prices for goods, or should be. I had no idea that pharmacies could increase the prices of medications just because they feel like it. Back to Good RX for me. They have always given me exact pricing, to the penny, and no pharmacy has ever increased the price on any medication, including controlled substances.

Patients who needed to see a doctor could always find someone and pay a reasonable fee if no insurance and expect to use most insurances including Medi-Cal and HMO. If they wanted to schedule with same doctor for follow up, this option was always available. Since June of , the billing structure has changed. The doctor has to pay $40 for each patient who books online, whether the patient is seen or not. This, of course, became a much more expensive proposition for the doctor and he has option to cap his monthly expense, which makes him unavailable to receive any future referrals after he reaches the cap. The new billing structure placed a huge barrier to patient-doctor interaction on Zocdoc. Firstly, the doctor can t afford to accept Medi-Cal or HMO patients anymore. Secondly, to cover increased expenses, the doctor must increase his charges for patients coming from zocdoc. Thirdly, the moment the doctor reaches his cap he becomes unavailable to more patients on zocdoc. Therefore, the choice of doctors, obviously, diminishes drastically. My advice, find a different service to look for doctors, just do a simple Google search. Zocdoc isn t worth it.

Medical care should be more delicately handled vs victimizing patients (I know this seems dramatic but when dealing with certain medical conditions and then needing to deal with this mess - it really does feel violating). I love ZocDoc s interface, all the info it provides, reviews, and such ease of use. Unfortunately providers seem to have difficulty syncing their system and show no cares in the world about the inconvenience and confusion it causes. I think it used to be better.

So try it out and if you feel like it doesn t work great for you then it might just take a little more time for doctors in my area to jump on the bandwagon. I still use it even though I can t book them all through there because it still helps!"

I love the fact that I can get on ZocDoc when I need to and find a doctor in my area fairly easily. For the most part the system works. However, I think the relationship ZocDoc has with its doctors needs help as I have been told more than once that the doctors don t work with ZocDoc even though they are listed on the ZocDoc app. I have had appointments that I ve booked through the app cancelled hours and days later for seemingly no reason. When contacting the doctors offices directly (mostly to find out why the appointment was cancelled) I ve been told that they don t work with ZocDoc. In three cases, two of them I was able to rebook my appointment directly with the doctors office. In one case, I wasn t able to book because the ZocDoc booking was canceled just days before the actual appointment. All of these situations were frustrating to say the least. However, I will give ZocDoc credit for creating a space where I can even find a doctor, which is way better than what my insurance company offers."

I ve tried searching for a pcp multiple times throughout the past year and when searching through my insurance portal or other search engines they would say the provider accepted new patients but when I called they actually weren t still accepting new ones or the next available appointment was months away. After trying and failing to find one, I would just give up for a couple months then try again. I randomly heard about zocdoc when listening to a podcast (shoutout crime junkie) and I thought I d give it a shot. I found a pcp and had an appointment booked for the next day. I m honestly so surprised that it was so easy. I d recommend to anyone."

I find that so many people don t understand their in network benefits - granted, I barely do myself and everyone s is so nuanced. Unfortunately, if you have an HMO, subsidized medical coverage (such as Medi-caid) or Kaiser, my options will be at the mercy of my insurance designated plan. But for those with PPO plans, ZocDoc is wonderful. I tell my patients it s Yelp and OpenTable for medical providers. Some tips, remember, to make sure you ve filtered for the actual specialist you re trying to find. For example, some patients that type in eczema or warts when they re trying to book with a dermatologist or ingrown toe nail trying to book a podiatrist will end up finding the urgent care. Sure, urgent care providers like me can tell you want to do but usually I m sure you wanted to see the dermatologist or actual podiatrist."

Another dermatologist who tried to sell me an egregiously expensive product and then wouldn t refill the prescriptions I ve used for years. A primary care physician where a later doctor described her care as there to get you out the door and irresponsible. The app shows drs drowning in positive reviews and seems to aggressively bubble compliments to the top. Drs can cancel with almost no notice and way too many agree to treat you online for conditions that they definitely should ask you to come in for. For all its glitz and polish, zocdoc pushes a last minute in and out approach to doctors that results in inferior care with professionals who are not significantly vetted or held accountable. Just call a dr to get quality care and never use this app - it is not worth it."

This is the second time I ve made the appointments and waited a half hour the morning of, only to get no messages about getting a link to the video calls (also specified under my appointment information). This is the second time my appointment has been cancelled without warning with no response without building the strength to reach out. This makes me realize why people don t reach out for help.

I came to this app to ease the trouble of calling every doctor and setting up appointments. It s frightening enough meeting a doctor for the first time and.they re terrible. They make you feel uncomfortable, insult you indirectly and/or their staff makes the entire experience even worse. What I got was exactly what I asked for. Easy to use, easy to review but there are still flaws. I ve had difficulty finding ones that take my insurance and then the issue of copay. You honestly never know what to expect. I ve had them call me only to find out what I m paying AFTER the entire session. For some it s $15, others $30 and it can go upwards of $300. The other issue is the rescheduling. I had one doctor completely inconvenience me by changing my appointment. That inconvenience led me to working on a day I usually had off and I ended up with a severe cold, forcing me to cancel majority of my other appointments. In the end, it s what you make of it. I m just not a fan of doctors cause in the end they just want money."

It is an easy app to use, but when I am searching for a specialist or a primary care provider it displays options that are at least minutes away. If I filter my results to a specific day, it displays (non sponsored) doctors who are in the NYC area when there are definitely a few closer doctors available. This could be a glitch but I was able to work through it and found an available doctor who fit my schedule. My only concern is that this app will always be more convenient for individuals in densely populated areas. I live in a big college town in NJ and I was still unable to find a doctor that was less than a 20 minute drive away. Again, it is a VERY convenient app to use especially if you are on the go but there needs to be a significant user increase in order for everyone to benefit from Zocdoc."

            "summary": "True Fit, the leading AI-driven solution that decodes size and fit for shoppers and fashion retailers, has announced its certification as a Shopify Plus Certified App Partner, helping fashion retailers selling on Shopify leverage AI-size and -fit recommendations to power conversions, improve customer lifetime value (CLV) and reduce returns.\nAs a hallmark of innovation and proven performance, True Fit is the first – and only – size and fit app to be certified on the Shopify Plus Certified App Program, which helps Shopify's largest merchants find the solutions they need to build and scale their businesses. The program recognises Shopify Partners who provide the highest levels of quality, service and support to meet the needs of Shopify Plus merchants, with its rigorous vetting based on: app listing and user experience; integration and compatibility; support and reliability; data security and compliance; and infrastructure and performance.\nTrue Fit first launched on Shopify at the end of 2023 and has since seen significant and continued growth on the platform, as more Shopify fashion merchants recognise the value of unlocking revenue through True Fit's Fashion Genome. The world's largest connected dataset for fashion, spanning over 82 million shoppers and nearly 30,000 brands, the Fashion Genome uses best-in-class AI to deliver high fidelity fit recommendations to customers, based on their unique size and fit preferences. By delivering fit assurance into shoppers' buying journeys, True Fit helps retailers grow conversions, revenues and CLV, whilst reducing size-sampling and fit-related returns.\nHeralding a new era of growth, True Fit has seen Shopify adoption increase by 509% over the last twelve months alone. Meanwhile, True Fit doubled the number of Shopify Plus merchants using its solution, while reviews for True Fit – a key requirement for enrolling into the Shopify Plus Certified App Program – were exceeded, with 100% of reviews receiving 5-star reviews to date.\nRecognised as a Shopify Plus Certified App Partner ahead of Peak Trading, True Fit is supporting Shopify merchants in readying their operations for Black Friday and the critical Christmas trading period. With fast and seamless integration, the True Fit for Shopify app can be deployed on merchants' sites in less than 5 minutes and, within 24 hours of go-live, retailers can access AI-size guidance from the Fashion Genome, serving 100% shoppers with high-fidelity fit-recommendations based on their unique preferences.\nAs Cailyn Nikolis, e-commerce director at boot retailer Frye, commented: 'This is the smoothest and fastest app integration I've ever done. We were able to get up and running quickly to be ready for Black Friday. We wish all tech partners made it this easy.'\nSue Butterworth, head of technical and compliance at Lucy & Yak, added: 'Enabling customers to quickly and easily find the right size and fit, first time and every time, is central to delivering online buying journeys where our customers feel supported and confident. True Fit's fit recommendation engine triangulates millions of data points, improving fit assurance, enhancing customer experience and growing conversions. It's also helping us target reducing size-related returns and size sampling behaviours, contributing towards our sustainability efforts.'\nJessica Arredondo Murphy, Co-Founder & CEO at True Fit, commented: 'Our Shopify app continues to grow and strengthen, underlining our mission to help brands of all sizes leverage AI to match customers with the garments they'll love. For shoppers, size and fit remains the de facto decider as to whether they convert or abandon their cart – by building fit assurance, backed up by AI and insights that connect over 400 million consumers across 21 billion Product Description Page views, we can help merchants significantly scale digital revenues, grow customer loyalty and reduce returns.'",

It's a bit annoying the special deals pop up multiple times without being clicked on but mostly cause it cause the game to lag. Aside from these issues the game is fun & addicting even.

The gameplay is painfully boring, the graphics are subpar, and the whole experience feels like a cheap knock-off. I'd rather stare at a blank wall for an hour than play this game again. If you're looking for a fun and engaging mobile game, steer clear of SuitU. It's a wast"

The only thing I want to improve is the daily task, obtaining the levels are pretty quick but it's only until level 70. I just wish that you max it out up to 100, because completing the tasks are easy yet it still has excess tasks. Completing the tasks up to 100 will make it more sensible because of the excess tasks."

The delivery people stole my package, and Fashion Nova did nothing to help. They said they couldn’t do anything about packages stolen after delivery, even though the package was never delivered in the first place. They refused to refund me or take responsibility. In the end, my savings were wasted with no solution from them."

If they raised the amount you got or lowered the amount it cost for everything then the game would be alot more playable and players would be able to progress in a fun way instead of it feeling like a chore."

The app is good for finding clothings you like that may not be in the actual store (yet)! \nBut the app it’s self is a disaster. Sometimes when I click “LIKE” on something, it doesn’t even “LIKE” it & doesn’t pop out on my “LIKE SECTION”. I just said to myself that it was  mineral issue. (Things got worse).\n I would have a lot of things I wanted to buy, but didn’t have the money at the moment. So I would just put them in my cart/bag and return to it later. On this app, I can’t do that. You may be asking why & it’s because, when ever you put something on your cart, it will literally disappear in a matter of 2 days. (I would open the app and go straight to my bag/cart. & it would say that it was empty but I just filled it like a day ago). \nI tried signing in because I thought it would start saving, but still had the same issue. & to even make the topic worse, when I view something on my cart and go back to view others; it would take minutes to load. & after that, it would start at the top of the cart again (how annoying is that when you have a lot of things). \n\nPLEASE FIX THIS!\nI have a lot of things I want to buy but don’t want to go to the actual store",

I tried multiple times and still was running into complications. I checked my bank account and turns out I was charged multiple times. Just a little over $1300 was taken out. Although I did get refunded my money I still wanted to the items and still was lingering in my cart. Still running into problems with the purchase I was told by customer service that it wasn’t just me and that I.T. is working on it. Also told as long as it’s in my cart it’s saved. When finally able to purchase the items I went to check out just to find out that one of the jackets no longer has one of the size. Settling for both large sizes for the jackets I still went with the purchase. It was marked as delivered on Tuesday but only for three of the items which were too large jackets at one extra large sweater. The other large sweater was showing that it was being processed in the warehouse. But I still haven’t received anything. Then Thursday morning I noticed that it was marked that all items were delivered. I called customer service about all of this and was told an investigation was going to be open and looked into. This is a major concern for me seeing the items I purchased is limited and feels like I would not be getting my items that I paid for.",

It’s all right enough if you have good enough vision but when you are very visually impaired or a limited site and use voiceover on your phone the app is basically useless. As well as even before I became visually impaired and did not require voiceover to work my phone I still have some trouble is using the app because although you can favorite clothes they will eventually just disappear from your favorites and then you have to find them again or sometimes hope they still have them at all. As I recently was wanting to buy some clothes and was just going to use the app due to the virus I thought would be easier but I soon discovered that the app does not work with voiceover as I can only read approximately maybe five or more things and it’s only an estimated guess of what it is I thought maybe I’d get by by just going to my favorites and just clicking on the first few things on my favorites list was completely empty. So while the app is manageable enough so long as you have a good enough vision and don’t use voiceover on your phone I definitely would not recommend it to anyone who is visually impaired or with limited site and requires voiceover on to work their phone please fix this and then maybe the apple be better.",

I have a system where I like to add everything I love (which is a lot at h&m) and then go through my cart to windle down what I have to have that moment. Having to do that pre-maturely and getting rid of things I love just to add something more takes the fun out of it and is actually really frustrating. I know this might seem petty in the grand scheme of world problems BUT come holiday times I don’t even want to bother with a site that can’t contain my shopping list (even if it is overblown) and that I’m constantly having to reduce/recheck or reorder. Pls at least allow 100 items or the option to save for later, like almost every other online retailer I know. I get the strategy but it doesn’t help compulsive shoppers like myself who also have adhd brain. It just makes me want to avoid your site altogether when I’m constantly deleting and re-adding, then deleting again just to make my list how I want it!!!!!!",

It is when you try and complete a purchase that problems arise. When I ordered my clothing, I realized it had my old address on file. I immediately tried to reconcile this through customer service but the agent said that I had missed my “15-30 minute window of grace period” to do this. It had in fact been less than 30 minutes and I feel that the agent deliberately responded late so that he could prolong our chat thus ensuring that I miss that “window.” It was absolutely ridiculous and I had proof via email confirmation that I still had time to get this fixed but the agent kept insisting that the button was no longer available to him. His suggestion was to return it upon arrival. Not sure how thats supposed to work when it’s getting sent to my old address. So frustrating and it was an easy fix for a multi-billion dollar company who surely has the resources to do something as simple as alter the shipping address 20 minutes after the purchase was made. Will never order through this company again.",

I call customer service telling them that I wanted to cancel it but they told me that I can’t anymore because of the date I purchased the item. So now I’m stuck with a item I don’t want anymore. \nThe refund took a whole other week for me to receive and I didn’t even get the full amount I payed for it.

Limiting to 60 is smart. I see the point because it forces you to put the 60+ in your cart. Who said I was buying now? I gotta make my money, honey, first lol.

We should be able to cancel our order within at least 30 minutes after our payment was completed! The only Way that you could cancel your order is through phone calls, and I have to say it is so inconvenient!!!! Right now I’m having this issue about Black Friday sales, there should be a 30% off on my payment but it didn’t happen to mine. But I accidentally pressed the pay button and now there’s no way for me to cancel it! I have tried to call for at least 10 times but it seems like that “ due to technical problems” my call can’t be answered!!!! THIS IS RIDICULOUS! And the app is always so slow.  I really like H&M but I’m very upset by this situation! If the ones that are in charge of this app sees this, would you please fix it ASAP? Thank you!",

But when H&M updated their app, I’ve had every excuse to hate shopping from there. First of all, you can’t look at you past orders on the “new” app. In general, their “new” app is glitchy and awful to use. Second, I know this sounds like a little bit of a stretch, but they sent me the wrong size of pants on purpose. They sent me a pair just a little bit smaller then what I usually get. I have a screenshot of my purchase before finalizing to even prove it. Even the recipe is different then what I ordered. Thought that was a little fishy, so I looked on the website to see if my size has been out of stock, and yes it was. And guess what size wasn’t, the pair I got. Used to like H&M, but I’m good on wasting my time and money. Quality has definitely gone down within the past year😔",

Love this store, just not the shipping or the app lol \n\nORIGINAL: \nI just dislike this app a lot because it’s inconvenient to use. H&M also has some of the worst delivery options and never actually give you a date for delivery just a broad, generic range (9-14 days standard). They are late often. The website has many issues, isnt up-to-date with my orders usually and offers no real help at all. Not happy with H&M at all right now.",

Another problem is there is now a limit to how many items u have saved and when things go out of stock it just says some items are out of stock and they don’t even tell u which items are they they just delete it . The worst part is that it’s hasn’t been saving my cart every day i have to find the items all over again and I don’t even know why I bother to take the time to do that . I should probably just take a picture of my cart to make it easier , but I shouldn’t even be doing that !!

I don’t know if it’s honestly that a bunch of 8 year olds play this game too or its just some weird computer system but the outfits that win are the ugliest/ mismatched, totally wrong styles. It drives me crazy!!! Like the \"contests\" where they tell you a specific style, like winter and I spend all this time creating a dope winter look and then get back on to find someone in a swimsuit won… like why even call a winter challenge? I kid you not, when they have the \"voting\", Ive come to the point where I pick the most backwards, \"polka dot & stripes\", ugly outfit because if you pick the one that is actually matching or stylish, its wrong!! ! I have ZERO other complaints other than it seems the \"contests\" are rigged with no real way of winning because I can throw on a fur coat for a pool party and win…. just unfortunate they cant make the game actually real where you compete based on something being cute or within the description…. instead its just really computers winning or people who put polka dot shoes with a plaid skirt and a striped shirt with a camo jacket…. anyway, recommend the game 100% but dont expect to win the challenges no matter how fashionable you are or how much your follow the \"instructions\" for the challenge. Absolutely will keep playing regardless of the unfair / or weird bots they use for the voting/ challenges.",

I missed two events and could not get the complete collection and there is no way to repeat it to get full collection. Other designer collections are always available and I can get items whenever I want to and I have the credit for it. But those from special event collections…Some were available that aren’t anymore after the recent update and I liked the collection a lot. I think it would be great to be able to repeat some events and games if we want to and couldn’t get the full collection. And also I wish there was a make up catalog and hair style catalog and not just clothing and accessories. We could buy some hair styles from money we have in stylist bank or even some gems. And not every hairstyle and make up style cost real money. There are few but would be great if there was a catalog having hair accessories like bandana etc and hair styles. Also I wish we could save some lipsticks in a place and not just the one we chose on the stylist lips. Would be good if there was a box with lipsticks we paid for by gems or even the money we earn by styling clients. Because video ads aren’t always available and would be good to have options to change lipstick whenever we wanted just like eyeshadow and nail color. 😊",

I give it a five because I don’t think anything is bad about it! When I first saw this game I thought I wouldn’t like it but then when I played I got upsets with it and then I played it every day from that time on I don’t know what I would do without this game. It saved my entire game life! I think it is pretty creative, VERY fun and even a tiny bit  more awesome then any game I have ever played. Also I like how there aren’t too many adds I mean I like adds but playing your game is a lot funner then watching adds. I bet you like this review and if not that is okay. JK (witch means just joking) if you don’t like this review you are evil! Just joking! We all have are own awesome opinions! Sorry if I am joking too much! Right after I played your game I knew writing a review would be really  easy because all I have to say is good stuff because there is nothing bad about this game. I’m sorry if this is too long for you! Also, sorry if there is any spelling errors I make a lot of spelling mistakes so it’s all my fault.\n Also, some of this might not make sense to you and I’m sorry about that I am not that good of a writer or not that good at making sense. Well, hope you liked my review and sorry for all the mistakes and thank you again for making this awesome game! I LOVE IT SO MUCH!",

As for other dress-up games, I enjoyed Love Nikki for a while but even that got repetitive and bogged down with extra, overcomplicated lore. This game is sweet, simple, and has a nice little variety of different style challenges that keeps the game interesting without making it over complicated or too hard. There is a nice balance in the free clothing options and the paid options, but you genuinely get nice outfits without having to put money in the game. That being said, this is the first mobile game that I actually wanted to put money in! My only complaint (which isn't really a complaint about the game) is that I'll get a client all dressed up where they're looking fresh as all get out, and then the client will say it's not for them 😑 it's realistic and I don't mind that feature, but boy do I give them ugly hair and makeup when they give me that sass! Lastly, I do hope that more eyeliner options become available because we don't have all the cool ones they show in the pictures for the game. Maybe I didn't start playing soon enough or haven't played for long enough? All in all, it's a favorite that I have kept coming back to over the last month or two!",

Well around September I noticed a few items I had won during an event, I didn’t have anymore, they were locked and I needed diamond to unlock even tho I had already won/purchased items. I sent them an email. Then I went back to look and I noticed I’m missing A LOT MORE! 2 entire collections of clothing (Cat walk and Desert Winds) that I worked so hard for on one event and spent money on the other. There’s even things I know are missing but since they were temporary I can’t take a screenshot of them. As I realized this I started sending updates because I spent HOURS and HUNDREDS of dollars at this point with them. I sent them the first email 9/24 and have yet to hear anything. Only once when I first sent an email, did I get the usual info they send about sending them a screenshot of my game. That’s it. I even sent proof that I had some items at one time, but again NOTHING. I’m so disappointed because I’ve been with them for years spent hundreds and invested hours in this game. I know they are avoiding me and I’m assuming think I’m lying because other times when I had an issue, It would be resolved within a week, 2 max. I’m never spending another dime with them unless they fix this. I have been nothing but kind and patient in those emails.",

              "review": "I got this game and immediately fell in love with it. It is a perfect game for all people who love fashion! All the events are so fun! But…. It could use a few improvements. First of all right now I am at a pretty good point. But at the begging I had to pay for my diamonds. I still do but now I can’t because my mom won’t let me buy any more. But anyway back to the beginning. I was on a bad start. If I didn't buy any diamonds then I would never have a good start and be on a good track. That is why I think that they should start you out with more diamonds. That way new people that buy this game either have to buy diamonds or can’t and are just going to be on a bad start for ever. Next I think that the box mini game in it is maybe a little well…. Rigged. I think it should be easier. I have been playing this game for almost a year now and I have only gotten the big reward like…. Five times! Although I have almost completed all of the fashion collections that are always there. Now next this might be more of a personal problem. I never turned of the sound and it still turned off. It now will not turn back on and it is a problem. Anyway this review is not meant  to  hurt the creators of the game. I just think if you could try to fix those things it might be easier for beginners. I hope you will read my review. Agin this is not meant to offend anyone. But I still love this game and definitely recommend it.",

My sister get the app when I was on lvl 13, and when I looked at there progress she was at lvl 15 😂🤣! This app is really fun. The up side are: when u log one u get the daily reward and then u get to spin a wheel that give u money, diamonds, energy, golden tickets or fashion play cards. The fashion cards let u get designer clothes and they mix up the choices. Now u get money for accepting clients calls. Before, u had to spend energy, and money to give clients clothes, and get half the price u spent on clothes for them back. There are so many other great things, but let’s move on the that one bummer we all know and hate, that stupid mystery card game! Three keys, u got two, and there are the last to boxes, you want to go with your gut, but you thing u will do it wrong, and BAM! Card ripped. U always go for the middle first, that’s all I know. But the part at the beginning we’re u see them in the boxes in a order, WHATS THE POINT! It’s impossible to memorize and u have to rely on pure luck to win. For the beginning part were u see them in the boxes, plz make a change and keep them in there spots when they get mixed up so when u go to pick the boxes, you know we’re they are. Again, I love this game for the bottom of my ❤️! But plz listen or at least think about my request bc I’m sure other people feel the same way to. Thanks bye 😊!",

I loved it and got to level 13 in the first week. But there are a few problems. Sometimes if i want to get lipstick for my customers, i will watch a video and it still won’t work. Also, I hate how it takes 5 hours for my customers to get to my shop. 5 HOURS!!! It’s a really long time, and I don’t want to pay 1,892 dollars to have them come now. Another thing, is that Elle Roberts is VERY annoying. She is always putting me down and i hate it. I get that it is just a game but people should have the option to block her, in my opinion. She really gets on my nerves. Also, customers will just stop calling. I will start playing, and i will just wait in my shop for like 10-20 minutes and nobody calls. But when i don’t have very much energy, that’s when everyone decided to call! Another thing, I don’t like the energy very much. I can only style like 3 outfits and then i don’t have enough energy to style any more. I think there should be an option that if you watch a certain amount of ads, it will give you 10 energy. Like 1 ad = 10 energy or something along those lines. But over all it is a pretty good game, I just think that those problems need to be fixed.

I did buy the 99 cent ad-free version because the regular ads were so frequent it made the game almost impossible to play. I do two biggest issues with the game still though. One, the constant pop-up in-app purchase ads are obnoxious to say the least. If I do any type of event, giving the customer their outfit, coloring game, etc. the screen then loads up a bunch of suggestions for in-app purchases that seem really excessive. Like 3 plus in-app purchase suggestions I have to click out of before doing anything else. It’s super annoying considering I paid for no ads, but the in-app purchases are just as annoying as regular ads. My other issue is that the ticket game seems to be wholeheartedly rigged now. I remember when I first had the app that I would occasionally, maybe once every 20 ticket games I played, that I got all 3 keys and unlocked the jackpot. I don’t think I’ve gotten all 3 keys in months and I play this game frequently. Statistically you’d think maybe I would get the 3 keys every so often, but it doesn’t happen at all anymore. I really do love the game, but sometimes those factors make me not want to play. I totally understand it’s important for the developers to get money in order to run the game and to get paid, but it seems like this game has just become a cash-grab.",

Annoying, purely on principle I choose that one , which I like, and not the “correct” one, regardless of the money. And by the way, the options approved by the developers look very strange and ugly, and you will never choose them, because they are ugly, in which case you will not get money. Advertising was also closed and because of this, many functions are unavailable, but advertising is still offered to watch. And why in competitions for example “Winter's Tale” or “Pool Party” a person in a fur coat, camouflage pants and massive boots can win at a pool party, but in “Winter fairy tale\" in a 2003 style top, in a polka dot skirt, and someone's grandmother's shoes, and crazy professorial glasses, when I create a suitable and very beautiful image?!

I do wish they would offer a few new hairstyles along with the clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories in the new lines that you can buy. \n\nAnd here is the reason I didn’t give a five star review… they recently added contests to the game. You earn currency to enter these contests by voting on other people’s designs. They give you a theme, you dress for the theme, pose your avatar and take a pic, then “post.” Doesn’t matter how hard you actually try to follow their theme for the contest. The “people” who win are always the ones in bathing suits with pictures of their backs. ALWAYS. Royal wedding? The winner used a bikini and posed backwards. Fantasy? Bikini with a picture from the back. Winter theme? Walk in the park? Day out with the girls? Job interview? Clubbing? Romantic dinner date? Yep, you guessed it, bathing suit!!! There is often a short hair challenge as well, and it almost never fails that THAT winner will have a bikini with long hair lol. I’ve tried to play the game and go the same route, but oddly enough when I do, I get 0 votes. I’m not sure if this is just a computer and there are no real winners, or what. But it really gets under my skin that I try to hard to build an awesome look, just to have people winning the contests who just use either bathing suits for everything or the worst, most mis-matched outfit they can think of.",

I play it almost everyday and it’s been great but I do have a few tiny issues. First is that whenever I open the app after a few hours without using it it gives me all these different pop ups telling me to buy stuff, witch of course is ok but I can be a little annoying sometimes. Next is that I feel that every time I style an outfit it’s always “ Amazing” or something along the lines of “This pivot is great” but sometimes I don’t even use the certain color they wanted or something like that, but they never say anything about it. Witch I understand that they want everyone to feel good about their creation but maybe sometimes the customer couldn’t get what they want and get mad or not want it or something like that. But I really love this app and it can be VERY addictive. Because of all the things you can click on for different prizes, that’s what makes a game entertaining and enjoyable. But enough talking about me, I just want to thank the developers for making this game and putting the time and effort to make the updates great and also respond to the reviews, I’ve been reading the reviews and they respond to most of them! So crossing fingers they see this one 🤞. That’s it! Thanks for listening 🤍💌",

But I would recommend a few changes. For example, I fell in love with some of the earring sets and eye make up sets that have been released, but I couldn’t get any of them because they cost real money, and I don’t think that’s really fair. After all, not everyone can afford to spend real money, and some of us have parents who won’t let us. I think that when they first come out you should at least be given a chance to earn them by completing challenges or something, and then after several days if you don’t get them all, then charge real money. I would also make the catalogs and vouchers for clothes cost less gems, and you should be able to use your money earned in the game to buy some of them too. It would also be cool to see things like hats, blush, accessories for hair, and please remove the feature where you have to watch an ad in order to access lipstick. Ads pop up often in the game (which I don’t mind), but 90% of the time I can’t put lipstick on a client because when I try to play the ad there isn’t one available. Other than that, this is an awesome game! Please keep up the good work and I look forward to seeing more updates in the near future!",

The outfits are cute and the shoes are adorable, overall, this is hands down a five star game…but as I started to play it more often I ran into some difficulties… first of all, but once I accidentally purchased a 9.99$ fashion pack because these offers started popping up on my screen which was disappointing. 😕 Although, keep in mind I did get a refund after 48 hours. 😁 Also, some of the #OOTD challenges are impossible to complete without either buying with real money ( which is never the best option ) or spending hundreds to thousands of diamonds ( and diamonds are really hard to get in the game without spending tons of money ) Lastly, some of the ads are inappropriate and have nothing to do with the game. Overall this is one of my favorite games of all time and it’s totally worth downloading. It’s really fun and entertaining. I love styling the characters and helping promote different lines and brands of clothing and accessories! I love unlocking different features and prizes as I unlock levels, you should absolutely show the developers some love, download their app, write them an awesome review and enjoy the game! 🥰🥰🥰",

The ads are way too much- but developers gotta make money so I get it. There is one after everything you do. I was willing to pay the amount to get rid of them permanently. It was worth it to me but may not be for you. Also the ads that I do watch in order to get additional money or gems - are sooo inappropriate it’s jaw dropping. If my child was playing this and saw these ads I’d be furious. I’m not sure if the developers can do anything about that though or maybe they can. Aside from those things this game is truly so much fun. At this point I’m just dying for more clothing options since I’ve acquired most of them now. If you’re willing to spend $20-$50 bucks on something to clear your mind and you love fashion - I recommend for sure! \n\nAfter reading other peoples reviews, I feel super lucky mine hasn’t glitched or anything. I’ve had nothing but a great experience with this. The developers have to make money which is why there are so many ads so the people complaining about that is odd to me. Nothing is free. I’ll continue to play this game even if it costs me some money as it’s my one thing I treat myself to game wise.",

It has always been a blast playing this game and it is one of the first games I had on my phone and I still enjoy today. But...With all my praise, I couldn’t award this game a five star rating because of my one complaint. The one issue I have with this game is that almost every time I open it on many to any of my devices, after a few minutes or even most times a few seconds, this game crashes and closes returning to my home screen on the device I was using. To be more specific, the game is opened, and after a minute or so of it getting fired up, the screen turns black, and then all of a sudden my home screen pops up and the game is gone, like I haven’t even opened it. And with this issue, my gameplay fallen and my wanting to play this game has fallen as well. Since every time I try to play the game it crashes, I’ve stopped playing the game all together because I literally can’t. I really hope that this gets the attention of some or developers so that this issue might be solve because with this issue continuing, I don’t even see the reason in having the game because is does not work!

And I think this game should have more info about her personal interests and lifestyles that you can decide! Every one needs a good Work, life balance and I don’t think this game completely showcases that. For example. Who Is the stylists parents? Is she married? Does she have kids? Does she have a pet? I honestly think this game is too basic. You people have the idea going that she has clients and all that other stuff, But I personally think that you have to add more and more details to draw more people into the game. And another problem is that the game has to much advertisements for stuff that costs money. I think that it should be more about earning stuff then what you have in real life and what you don’t have. And I get that the developers need money. But people are just looking for entertainment not another reminder of money!!! Cause people don’t need another Reason to think about that! Oh and also. More on the money…. I have around ten thousand dollars in the game. But a client needs a new sporty dress catalog. But it costs 20,000 dollars and then you stop getting clients, and then you stop getting money to buy the catalog. So after me naming all of this you developers need to take this into consideration if you want to keep people playing your game. So, thank you. But if you could respond to this as soon as possible that would be great 👍🏻",

The winners are always some randomized outfit like a bright pink jacket with dull tan sweatpants and like an ugly orange shirt or smt like that and the other outfit MATCHES WITH COLOR but yet the ugly outfit wins! It should be called “which outfit does not match?” Or smt Bc the outfits are the most randomized you’ve ever seen. They don’t match by color OR style at all. They will be total opposites of the color wheel like blue, red, and yellow and smt will be fur, smt will be polka dots, and another will be bright neon. I’m not even kidding so you have no chance in guessing correctly. There are also too many ads may I add. Every 10 seconds is an ad. If u click on anything, an ad pops up. Wanna change ur avatar? An ad pops up. Wanna style someone? An ad pops up. And everything costs real life money as well! Not everyone has a money farm growing off trees! I’m just rlly upset that y’all make everything so overpriced as well! Like a new hairstyle for 120 gems? And u have to buy the gems as well with real money. I’ve been playing for 2 years now and I only have 50 gems. Mostly Bc I only get like 3 or 5 gems time to time from challenges. Many things are overpriced and votings are rigged. It’s a fun game I’m ngl, but the sense of fashion this game has is crazy. Never wear a polka dot skirt with a ragged oversized dull tan shirt with a neon pink coat 😭",

You’ve probably tried others and they just don’t meet your satisfaction, but this game, Super Stylist, will! You can be as creative as you like, and there are more that 3 shirts to choose from! I’m currently at level 25 and your options get wider as you play more. I love playing this game.\nMy only thing that bugs me is unwanted purchases. I don’t mean with real currency or anything, I mean in the game. When you open the game you have to click through all the news, daily sales, monthly challenges, etc. Sometimes, when I’m clicking through, I accidentally purchase something I don’t really need/want. THIS DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELY CRAZY! It happened to me again today, I was at maybe 150 diamonds, and I accidentally clicked purchase and bought a bag. My currency on the diamonds went to 21. My suggestion for the game is for when you purchase something over 1000 cash or 5 diamonds, it has a pop up saying, “Are you sure you’d like to purchase?” Or something similar.\n\nAll in all, it is a super fun game, and I enjoy playing it, I just don’t like the unauthorized purchases.",

I’ll bet most of the people who wrote those bad reviews, haven’t even PLAYED the game! HOWEVER, there is one complaint I have with this game. So, whenever you do these fashion contests against someone/something the person/thing you are playing against, is dressed up like you were spun around in a Walmart, blindfolded, and told to pick out whatever you touch. I’m not sure if there really is just a little kid who doesn’t know how to dress-up something, or a bot. Also, most times the opponent ends up winning! I get so frustrated thinking, “How in the actual HeCk did this person win wearing stripes with plaid???” acting like Barbie. Another concern similar to the previous problem, is that when you do voting competitions the most OUTRAGEOUS outfits always and up with victory. And so every time I end up doing the vs. stuff, I pick the weirdest thing in order to win, and when it does i’m already on the other side of my room pointing at the phone saying,”BrUh,”(And for a 15 yo it’s kind of annoying no cap) Other than that, this game is pretty awesome! ~Jennifer~ ╮(￣▽￣\"\")╭",

However, you can tell that after a couple rounds, no matter how well an outfit matches the category or whatever score you got it in the past, you will not win the round. You usually know that the game is slightly rigged when all the heart eyes emojis appear for all 4 items appear for both you and the other model. Then you will always lose by two points. There have been so many times in this game that I put together an outfit that made a perfect 30, then put it on again for the same category, and lose by two points to the other model. It makes you angry, so they offered to do a revenge, you will always in when the revenge no matter how bad your outfit is. Stop rigging the game, if my outfit gets one score one time, keep it consistent. I don’t wanna lose because you need to make money. If it’s a 30 once, make it a 30 everytime.",

No matter what outfit you choose and both of the computer character and your own character both get all heart eyes, the computer character will score higher with the judges no matter what. It’s very easy to win, but almost always the computer will win at least 1 out of every 5 rounds. No matter how good you do. 2) needs more concepts,outfits,hair styles, here’s a few ideas: cowgirl, goth girl, princess, spooky, Christmas, could even do countries, or cities. 3) more customization for your character, like maybe instead of having presets maybe you could have a customizable model, and also customization for the runway, like maybe we can spend the gems we earn on different looking runways. 4) more creative chapters, like better backgrounds n stuff. Overall it’s a pretty addicting game and such, I really like it, and think it could do really good. It’s something to play when you’re just wanting to kill time, still gets very repetitive tho. Would like to see more added to it☺️ OH ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING! To add, needs background music. Maybe potentially matching the chapter your at? Or if that’s too much then just some funky little tune for it would be nice. Also, more events please, maybe even like seasonal events or somethin, challenges even. Idk just a cool thought.",

The game includes fashion battles, which mean there is a random theme and you have to try to match the theme. At the end of the battle they will rate you on how well you matched the theme. You also get to collect lots of characters and I am so happy because I collected all of it already. The improvement is not that bad but just needs to take away lots of ads. For example, when I’m done competing in a battle, it says continue but always gives me an ad before I start another battle. It even gives me ads in the middle of the battles which is okay but just sometimes jumpscares me because its so sudden 😂. Also I can’t pause the battle so please make sure you add a pause button because I always lose if I leave my phone out to do something, and sometimes have to go out of the app for it to pause, which means I have to start another battle. Besides that the entire game is SOOOOOOOOO fun I love the new update on how you get to colllect animals as your buddy! And the new fairy characters. This game is so entertaining, you should download it for FREE! ♡︎",

You can unlock chests by completing tasks and it is super fun to have something to look forward to. I do have some problems with this game, too. I think it is too realistic. The boobs are so realistic. It is really disturbing to look at. And the game always says it is online, and every time you are playing against someone from around the world every time. But whenever I play somebody, I win, like every time. And they always pick stupid outfits. Like, it says to dress for a gala, and they choose a bathing suit. I also don’t like how it is so hard to unlock a new city. (You will see if you play it). Other than that, this game is the best game I have ever played. I wake Up at 5:00 a in the morning every day so I can play this game. I love it so much. You can also pick your avatar. You can pick a good finisher to make your opponent feel bad when they lose. And you can add special effects to yourself like tattoos and diamond sparkles. This game is the best. I TOTALLY recommend downloading this game. Like, now.",

It’s a great game honestly, but I feel like there are a lot of ads like between every single round you kinda like have to push through to see to actually play the game. Honestly, I feel like you should lower the ads price then you would get a lot more money paid honestly, and however, it is a great game, but I feel like you could also add a bit of like funnier fashion, designs, or like let all those likes pursue to buy some thing like a yeah but otherwise developer of making this game you did a great job I would just recommenda bit more improvements about the graphics and please lower your ad price. It’s annoying when you have to go through every every round. Thank you and if you are still reading this, I recommend downloading it if you really, really love fashion games but if you hate annoying ads and don’t wanna break your device, I don’t recommend playing this.

I was sitting bored in my room then I came across this ad and I really enjoyed what it showed because the outfits were really pretty so I downloaded it when I first played it. It was really fun and then I started playing it until my fingers were sore. My fingers could not even hold my phone anymore. One thing that was really fun about this app was that you could dress your style, and when you win every crown, you can keep going, and there’s no limit to what you can do. You can even lose sometimes it doesn’t matter, even if you lose the outfits might be pretty your opinion the judges are not real human beings. I think but they are really good at stating style when someone had a really ugly outfit. They they said it was pretty cause they didn’t want it was just one time when I was sitting in front them to feel bad so they gave a 10 eight and one I really love this app. It’s because you can get limited diamonds they’re so pretty, and I’m so grateful that they put different races because all the races are pretty and their own style",

I also love how you get different chapters and different concepts. Another thing I noticed is that every time you get all hearts, you win. But if both of you get all hearts, the computer always wins by like 2 or 3 points! Even if you think you did it better than them. Like I always lose when we both get all hearts. Also, it can be very frustrating when you have no competition. Like they make it so easy to win in some rounds. Like once in Bohemian, when it was the concept, the other person didn't even dress Bohemian! But I kind of get that, like they might not have known what it was. But things like Beach, come on. Everyone knows what the beach is. And in Masculine, the competitor wore a rainbow zebra top. That’s not masculine at all. Over all, it’s a really great game.",

The game had some over used concepts, which is completely normal in some games! However, the game has a pattern. The game is basically: you win two rounds (maybe three?) then lose one in a nutshell. I also wish there were more ways to customize your character besides just picking skin color. Why not eyes or nail color? Or lip color? I also noticed that the game has a pattern of scoring. If you get everything right in the categories this is what the scoring would be.. if the opponent got a 19, you would get 27-28. If the opponent got a 20, you would get 28. If the opponent got a 21 you would get a 29, and if a 22 you would receive a 30. The game has very predictable scoring and rounds. I also see a lot of models with VERY tacky clothing and yet they still win. Who wears gym shoes to the beach?! Like c’mon 🙄. I also think there should be more clothes and hairs and shoes and accessories. That’s all, besides those issues.. the game is good. 😊",

So like I said there is one thing that I’ve been waiting for ever since I got this app. And that is makeup. I once saw one of the AI’s wearing makeup. And yes I did say AI’s because I have proof they are I have never ever ever gotten a revenge battle from them. And I always do that if I lose. And I got the app in I’d say 2021 and it’s 2023 so that would be 2 years ago but I have a tie whether it’s 2021 or l 2022 it’s a debate with myself to find out. And my BOY cousin literally asks me if he can play and he’s only 3 weeks older than me. And this app would be amazing if that little itsy bittsy update was coming soon and for real now don’t just say it do it the same thing I tell my mom when she texts while driving “Don’t say sorry just do it” well it’s similar.

I get that it’s for money but there are WAY too many. Second, there has to be more time to choose the clothes. You only get 15 seconds to choose. Next, You also need to have more detail and options. There should be at least 5 or more options for each one. There should also be makeup and accessory options. Then, I don’t know if it is just me but the game is kinda glitchy. Once, I went onto the game and my character was bare. What if a little kid saw that glitch? There also needs to be boy/ men and kid characters not just girls/ women. Finally, it is way to easy to win or lose sometimes. Even if you have the ugliest outfit you win. Even if you have the nicest outfit you lose. \n\nIf you read all of it, Thank You.

I will!” And I win bc it’s flipping rigged! I hate rigged games!

I am on battle 155 and I haven’t had a big problem with it. The outfits are gorgeous. I love the details that they put in it and models look real, but not fake either.

Especially if a parent sees they could get in tons of trouble for it. I still believe you should add more than just females tho.

If you’re just buying likes to get to the next chapter, what even is the point of the likes? If you spend money to buy the special packs, after you get through the special categories, it’s the same categories over and over, which wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing but the outfit and accessory chooses are also the same thing over and over so it gets boring quickly. Plus, whenever your avatar/model and the competing avatar/model both get “love” emojis for everything, the competing avatar/model wins by two points EVERY SINGLE TIME. That’s really stupid. The graphics could be much better but I could even overlook that if the rest of the game was better. And what’s with the stupid dance the avatar/model does every time you win? This could be a cool game if the developers step it up.",

This can get pretty annoying even though the goal is to win and to have the better outfit. Second, this game isn’t a brilliant choice for younger kids, for example, some of the words they use can be inappropriate and also it teaches children to be rude to the loser. Just as you push you opponent off and act like it’s amazing and incredible that you won. This should be changed and teach others to be good sports, they could do this by changing the rudeness into a high-five. And last, the adds can get pretty annoying. In the middle of a game, an add will pop up and can interrupt your game. This can be changed by showing adds at the end of a round or before a round. Otherwise this is an amazing game and I recommend it. \n\n   Wishing you all the best, \n                                                      Myra",

The clothes are cute and constantly being updated, I love the art style, the makeup and hair are cute, and you can fully customize any outfit as you please and create something sleek, or something straight out of a fantasy movie, the creativity is seriously endless. Whatever you want to make, you can. And the VERY best part is that you don’t have to spend real money. I’ve cashed in a few times, but my girlfriend never has and is at an even higher level than me. You can get gems through voting, daily gifts, and watching short ads, and it works. I seriously appreciate it. I usually eventually grow tired of fashion games, but I always come back to SUITSME. It’s easy to use, but has the right amount of competition to make it feel actually exciting to get results. If you’re looking for the perfect fashion game to show actual creativity, not spend real money on, and do real voting with, this is for you. I love SUITSME.",

              "review": "Best fashion game out there imho... you can actually play and win without spending a cent. However, why not support a game that gives you hours and hours of fun versus a night out? Dinner and a movie costs far more and is gone when the evening is over. The improvements needed? I agree wholeheartedly with everyone else about the voting... it really needs improvement. This problem is why I did not give the game five stars.  It is very disheartening when you put a lot of effort into following the instructions... googling the era or person... and someone else wins who paid no attention whatsoever to the parameters given... for example, tossing on a gown  for an event that specifies a roller blading theme... I mean, come on. One thing that would really help is if we had the option to skip... all too often, I am forced to vote for the lesser of two evils and a truly horrible option gets points it does not deserve. I know for a fact some mothers let their toddlers vote and even style. Another thing that is needed is a much better search tool... there are literally hundreds of options to scroll through and the ability to search using subcategories and even typing in words like tulle or lace or sheer, etc. would be very helpful. Note to SuitsMe... please don't tell me to send my ideas to Support... your Support button sends me to a computer based email which I do not use, so it does not work for me. I use internet email, and I think most people do.",

              "review": "So I don’t usually write reviews ever. I’ve never written one actually. But I feel the need to leave a review here. I love this game, I’ve been playing nonstop since I downloaded it a couple weeks ago. I love that there aren’t ads unless you wanna watch one for more gems or something and the game itself is really fun. But lately, I’ve been having issues with the ratings. I was getting such high ratings when I first started with a few low ones here and there. But lately every single look is far below half, which would be fine, but the looks above mine usually have nothing to do with the prompt and I don’t get how they’re being rated so high. I feel like there needs to be a change in the ratings somehow. I’m not sure if they’re completely random, but I think there should be some sort of moderator to dictate if the looks are at least following the prompt. It’s insane that the looks that have been rating high don’t follow the prompts whatsoever. I don’t like that I’m spending a bunch of coins and gems creating looks to go with the prompt just for looks that don’t follow it to rate so much higher than mine. I’ve seen other reviews mention this too so I think something needs to be done about it. I hope that something can change because like I said, this is a really great game and I actually really enjoy it. If you’ve read this far, thank you and please take what I’ve said into consideration.",

              "review": "I feel like A LOT of people who play it, have no idea what they’re doing in regards to putting together a look for each challenge. Maybe it’s a bunch of young kids playing, but a lot of the top 5 looks do not even match the challenge, or there are MUCH better looks who are in the bottom of the 10. For instance, with the Elizabeth Bennett challenge, the 1st place winner, along with the additional 2nd and 3rd place winners all dressed extravagantly, with tiaras and lots of sparkle and jewels. Had they read the challenge description or even googled who she was, they would know she was poor. People are just voting on the prettiest looks, and not on whatever look fits the description, it makes absolutely no sense. I spend real money on this game, buying season passes, along with packs & gems and am so disappointed with this. That is the only up-side to Covet. The voting is at least fair and it seems as though older people are playing it, and playing THAT game correctly. Please, if you don’t know who a person is, simply GOOGLE them so you can at least see a pic of the person. It’s absolutely ridiculous and I’m about to stop playing because it’s just really unfair. If you’re not going to take the time to read the challenge description or are completely unaware of the person you’re supposed to be dressing as, why even bother entering the challenge or voting?!",

              "review": "Earlier today it was working fine, but the last few votes I did when I sat through the ad for the bonus gems, it never actually gave me gems/the option to collect them. Same with the little bonus ads you can watch every five minutes to get five gems. I tried to that a couple times and the ad just ends and takes me back to the store where I have to wait five minutes for a video to be available, but my gem amount is the same as when it started. \n\nOverall I do enjoy the game quite a bit! I feel like it’s even helping me better understand my own wardrobe and creative ways to reuse pieces. Like others I agree that the voting system can be a drag when you end up with top place finishers who aren’t on the theme (how did second place in my round of rainbow daze go to a b&w monochrome outfit 😭) but I have no suggestions for what would address that, just seems like a thing that’s going to happen sometimes. Maybe if people can’t vote in rounds they have an entry in to encourage them to vote more fairly? Idk. It’s a drag when it happens but most of the time I think the results tend to make sense.\n\nI also love that it’s just a straight forward fashion game. No puzzles or stories to sit through, those kinds of games are everywhere and it’s refreshing to have one that’s simply “login, dress up, move on.”",

              "review": "Overall, the game is fun, and I haven’t spent a dime. However, I have a few issues. First, the filter feature needs a lot of work. You can select a color to filter and see an item clearly labeled a different color, so if you filtered for that color you’d never see it. Also, pajamas… they’re under every “style” you can filter. There’s no easy way to find them. That’s also true for the robes. They’re under capes in different styles. I don’t understand why there isn’t a sleepwear category like for the under layers. \n\nLike I said, I haven’t spent a dime. Lately, I’ve played so many rounds to earn all rewards of that week’s season. My streak is currently 287, but it’s starting to feel like a job instead of fun. This is especially true when I get a low score and the winner has a very plain/basic look (sometimes not matching in the slightest). This doesn’t happen very often, but after spending hard earned cash and gems, it’s frustrating, and I’ve seen others that totally should have won. For example, one design was #2 and an almost identical design was #9. The only difference? The shoes. The shoes on the #2 design was sneakers and the #9 was heels… the outfit? Dresses. I’d very upset if that was me. \n\nThe game is just too much of a hassle, and the time required to earn the rewards makes this game less fun than it’s worth. It’s time for me to move on to something else.",

I do have a few qualms, one of which, is the amount of time I have to wait between each new hairstyle/makeup reward. In all fairness, at least said hairstyle/makeup rewards are free instead of the player having to spend a ton of money in the interim just so you can have a decent options base.  I also struggle with the fact that the make up options are predesigned, full-face looks instead of individual components that you can combine to better suit your style. Even still, there are a wide variety of options and chances are, you can find a makeup look that you like. I love seeing the new additions every time you level up and or a new season begins. It’s like a never ending wardrobe, what’s not to love? The organization methods for sorting each category (tops, bottoms, jumpsuits, etc.)have been updated and continue to be updated, so though it’s still not a perfect system, it’s getting better. You can tell that the makers of the game tried to be very inclusive with a variety of skin tones to choose from including some more untraditional ones. All in all, even with tiny nuisances, the game is a great download and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a realistic fashion/makeover game.",

Plus, the graphics are far superior and there are significantly more challenges per day that are varied in requirements and theme. That being said, there are some issues I have with it. First being that I’m a season pass player, but despite my activity, I am never able to finish it and gain all the rewards. I think the season time limit needs to be extended a few more days or so. A final problem I have with it, is the rating system. I notice that sometimes it depends on how much time is left on the challenge that determines the score. So, I typically don’t play challenges that only have a few more hours left since that’s less time my outfit can be rated on. I also notice that my looks are now struggling to get the ratings they deserve (based on the time, gems/coins spent, and being on theme). I wouldn’t be as frustrated if I felt that the looks ranking higher deserved the score. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of my submissions that I don’t think are the best, but it’s discouraging when the ranking and rewards gained don’t match up with how much time and currency I’ve spent on them.",

The only thing is the prettiest/trendiest items are going to be pricier and make you spend all those gems in an instant. Things range cheap from 120 coins all the way up to 1300 diamonds for things like hair and jewelry. A lot of times you need to buy these items to get an outfit that looks decent and fashionable. It is very difficult to score perfectly to get high scores for prizes and even then the most gems you can win is like 2000 for a look that costs you 4500 gems to begin with. You get an entry reward of anywhere from only 30 to maybe 300 coins? That barely covers stockings and a handbag. And the daily videos, voting, and gifts are a joke. You get 20 diamonds as a daily gift and to even watch a video to get more you only get 7-8 more gems. And for voting you have to vote on like 5 outfits and you only get like 5 coins or 12 gems at the most and then it ends. This game wants your money. I even paid the starter pack. I guess if you want horrible scores and re use clothes to do the “daily deal” challenge or whatever it is called maybe you can earn a little more, but this is ridiculous. And I’ll probably get a message from the developers that it is a “free game” and “tips on gems” when really it doesnt help.",

The farther you get the more money you get and the more things you have access to. I like how there are the Best Value challenges so if you are needing more money I recommend those. There are so many more pros I have but I’m to lazy to right all of them. Cons: This is a weird but understandable con, I want there to be more makeup looks with brown eyes. I love blue eyes because I have blue eyes but some characters I make need brown eyes.

I had suspected for awhile that I was getting charged twice for purchases.  And today I discovered that I was in fact being charged twice.  I had made a purchase on Feb. 9th totaling $3.27.  I received the email confirming the charge, it was on my checking transaction.  Today I received another email confirming a charge for the exact same purchase, same amount but the charge was from the 17th.  I KNOW I did not make that same purchase twice. But I received a second email and the charge appeared twice in my bank transactions.  I have disputed the charge.  Best bet is to not give these games money, but if you do make sure to keep an eye out for them double charging you.  They like to do it with the smaller amounts thinking you won’t notice, or care enough about going through the hassle of disputing it.  Also, they make it near impossible to contact them directly, you go in circles trying to set up accounts.  If you do get double charged, go directly to your bank to dispute it.  Better yet, don’t buy anything to begin with.",

I shouldn’t complain on this one, which was golf attire, because I did win the event, but second place was a lady in PUMPS!!! What?! When was the last time someone on the LPGA tour played in pumps? I entered one that was supposed to be work attire that you can then go out with friends in. Granted, nobody specified what job it was but some of the outfits were best suited for a stage with a pole and the outfits got over 4 stars! Other than that kind of job I honestly can’t think of where those outfits would be appropriate, yet they scored high. I have seen white pumps with black slacks! Fashion nightmare! Apparently the “two touching” rule no longer is alive. A lot of the voters/ players I think have a side job as escorts based on the winning designs. Whatever. It’s still fun I guess but expensive. We need a bigger reward than 15 coins. I get a better raise at my job and they’re cheapskates.",

The only issue I have with this game is that it makes it feel as if you HAVE to buy the micro-transactions. It’s kinda hard to participate in all the contest you want when the clothes are pricey. Don’t get me wrong  I live for the style the different themes and layout and everything but sometimes there are interesting contest I can’t enter because I spent all my coins and diamonds on the two-three contest I entered when just downloading the game. I had an issue recently where I voted a bunch and watch a video/ad and even spent my diamonds to obtain enough to enter a contest that had a dressing requirement of two items I couldn’t obtain because I initially didn’t have enough to buy it but the other I already owed but I couldn’t use it in the end when I went to submit my entry which made me kind of sad. Besides those things I absolutely would have rated a 5 star no doubt but other than that great game!",

Like $500 dollars and 250 diamonds. Something along those lines. 2. Everything is expensive. So unless your using REAL money and buying stuff in game it gets boring after level 5 because you can hardly afford anything after playing a few times. Yea they give you rewards for entering but not enough for what your spending. For example I’m guessing it’s the daily freestyle that gives the most reward back. Only $250. But your spending way more than that on the whole outfit. Other selection on the games only give you like $70 lol like what is that ??? 3. So you bought all those clothes right each outfit maybe around $700-$1000 in game. Probably more if your a tad bit fancier sometimes lol. But get this, the gag is you can only wear them ONCE. You spent all that money and can’t rewear the outfit UNLESS YOU PAY AGAINNNNN 🤦🏽‍♀️🤣 So as I stated in the beginning it’s fun but only up until level 5.",

There is a decent variety but I feel like there could be more options added, I understand that the basis of the game is designer labels sometimes it just feel like there isn’t anything i want to pick from in certain categories. \n\nI also have an issue with the payout system of the game, I can only make one or two outfits to submit a day. And the price of buying gems is wayyy too expensive. I feel like if you lower the price of gems to somewhere around $3 for say 500 gems you would get a lot more people willing to put money into the game. That coupled with more options and you’d have me invest more time and money into this game. I still go and design outfit for every challenge but it’s such a bummer that I have to choose carefully which challenges I enter. \n\nThis could be a great game it just needs a little tweaking!

I haven’t spent money and I’ve been able to hit the challenges and I’ve only been playing a week so there’s no excuse “not enough gems/money”. If we all start doing this maybe the other players will learn and the developers will start making more requirements to submit a look. If you don’t know what something/someone is, GOOGLE IT! It’s not hard to know that grunge is different than goth. It’s not hard to make a superhero look. It’s not hard to know they wear extravagant gowns at the Met Gala, not skimpy sundresses. It takes the fun away if all people are doing is submitting a random look for each challenge.",

I also honestly think people are going on and throwing votes by voting for the ones they think are worse to hopefully give their own style they created for the challenge a potential higher chance by throwing off the curve. Sometimes it seems more real and I don’t think this is just bias because sometimes the style in first place is so ridiculous it doesn’t seem remotely possible that everyone thought it was good. I’m saying this knowing that it may reflect on my style as well since I normally score between 4-4.6 out of 5. Is there any way to keep the voting more honest?",

They set up a season bonus where supposedly you get 8000 gems , but set the scoring so high you would have to have perfect scores to win them. This is almost impossible with their voting system where people mainly click left or right and you have to go above 9 other supposedly random players . On a left or right click the average player will not always end up at the top of a voting pool , that’s just a fact. Now on to “random” voting pooles. They are not so random as you will be paired against some of the same players , which may have many more $$$$ to spend and this is done to leverage scores so you don’t win too many diamonds without having to buy those gems to put you over the top. At the end of the season you probably won’t have the 8000 diamonds and you will start the next season at a disadvantage and the cycle will repeat until you actually PAY to play. If you want to waste real money, they’ll help you. They always respond to reviews as, you don’t have to pay to play and you don’t, but if you want to progress you have to .",

But it’s a little annoying when you spend your own money buying things for the themes and you think you did a great job, but then you find out you’re in last place because you lost to others who didn’t even wear what the theme specified. Furthermore most of them look horrible. I’m not trying to sound harsh but it’s just very frustrating. There has to be something you guys can do to change that problem.

I’ve searched everywhere for a solution and have tried every advice I have gotten but so far nothing has worked. Whenever I open the app from my phone every pin is an empty grey box. I wouldn’t mind this if it weren’t for the fact I like using it on my phone more than my other devices. The screen is smaller and fits the picture perfectly, I can write notes on pins that I cannot do for some reason on my tablet, or view my favourite ones, and it is overall easier to use.

I enjoy using it for inspiration and to help me visualize things for future plans or projects, so in that way it continues to mostly serve its original purpose.

The amount of ads was frustrating enough for a while, but now I will get pages of imagery that  isn’t actually showing real places or even real people. If I’m using Pinterest to get ideas for a realistically achievable patio space, or a new hair style or hair color, I don’t want to see computer-generated images of women who all have the same face or a landscaping job that doesn’t actually exist. Pinterest has a lot of value as a tool to help communicate goals and visual wants to professionals working with clients. How is it fair to professional designers if their clients keep bringing them images of things that never existed in reality in the first place? How is it fair to those same artists and designers if the work that is getting pinned and shared is not theirs, but is instead generated by a machine ? It’s frustrating at a basic level and very eerie and disturbing at another. I would love to see Pinterest advocate for the artists, designers, and content creators who use this space by cracking down on AI-generated posts. At least then the amount of ads might be more tolerable.",

I was accustomed to searching for boards so that I could easily follow other people who shared my very specific interests, but now that option has been gone for months! I’ve been meaning to write this review since then, but this newest update from a few days ago expedited it. Another of my main issues is the shopping aspect. In the older versions, it was more geared to crafting/diy/budget ideas. Now, I search for something simple like knitting ideas, and all I get back are shopping suggestions and priced items for sale. And there’s even a shopping section! I understand the need to evolve and bring in new demographics, but I feel that a lot of Pinterest’s original draw and identity has disappeared. Now, it behaves more like an Instagram or Facebook feed, filled with advertisements and shopping. It’s very disappointing to me that Pinterest has become so much like all the other dime-a-dozen social media apps and sites, since I initially fell in love with it years before because it avoided that world I hated. It felt quiet, calm, secluded, like a library or a yarn store, and I could do my own thing with topics I loved across the “board.” I am really, really bummed about all the changes and am considering deleting, which would be a major change.

I’ve logged out, deleted the app and reinstalled it and it still continues to do this. i recently uploaded something and when someone commented, i liked their message and the “liked by creator” showed up but it still won’t for my older posts. i tried ignoring it but it’s really frustrating and i hope pinterest fixes this soon. i really don’t want to delete everything and re-upload it or delete my account entirely.",

I mainly use it to curate aesthetics and find inspiration for my life. It’s very soothing and artistic to me, and the only social media I’ll use. However, I feel as though Pinterest has recently gone down hill. There’s an overwhelming amount of ads. To the point of every other pin is an ad. Most of them are irrelevant to me and my feed is no longer aesthetically pleasing, just full of junk. And I’m not opposed to tasteful ads- I’ve even bought multiple products advertised to me on Pinterest that had beautiful ads that matched my interest and weren’t overwhelming. But there’s just too many now and too many pointless ones. It makes Pinterest significantly less enjoyable. I also don’t understand why Pinterest no longer shows you who pinned the pins in your feed, and when you click in you can’t click on the original user who pinned. It’s totally confusing and counterintuitive- I keep trying to click the icons of people to view their profile but I can’t. The best way for me to do it is to scroll through the hundreds of people I follow to find them. It’s a huge pain. Please make peoples profiles clickable from their pins like they used to be. I’m satisfied with most of the other features of this app and glad to be a part of the community!",

I thought the idea of scrolling down was to find similar pins as it used to be, I guess that’s wrong now??\n\nAnd one more thing! Why does Pinterest keep deactivating pins! Almost everyday for the last year Iv had Pinterest send an email stating they have deactivated one of my pins for violent or inappropriate behavior. I always submit an appeal and you know why? Most of what I save is art and or photography. I don’t save any nudes or violent acts, so I kept wondering why my pins were getting deactivated so I started trying to use the “one time link” which btw doesn’t show you pin if your on an app on your phone. Either way I would get some idea of what pin was being deactivated and look out for it once it was released again. When I found out MOST OF THE TIME IT WAS A WOMAN SHOWING A FREAKING SHOULDER?!  Or a LEG. This is getting out of control! I get that Pinterest wants to keep young children away from inappropriate things, but a woman showing skin is not inappropriate ( I’m a woman btw). I also save items for book fandoms and Iv had so so many of those pins get deactivated, but like why? Bc a guy has his shirt off? Bc a woman is in a bathing suit??? I’m saving anything involving sex over here?",

Before banning my account, you’ve given me a warning for one of my pins being “inappropriate” but later had reinstated it. Why even bother taking it off in the first place? Not to mention giving ME a warning for pins I saved because they somehow contained things that had gone against your guys’ policies. Why am I being punished for saving them when I’m not the one who created them? If you see a post that supposedly goes against your community guidelines, take action and don’t let it linger. People will assume that the image or video is appropriate for the website, BECAUSE IT WAS POSTED AND ALLOWED. but suddenly, they get warnings because they saved it? I’m sorry, I love this app, but it’s really frustrating when you’re banning innocent accounts when there is actual gross pins that have broken every single one of your guidelines, and they’re scot free.

I use all the platforms so I know that if you change from the home feed to your profile or to the search tab back to the home feed, the home feed automatically refreshes... when I even open the app sometimes I see a pin right away that I’d pin but for some reason it refreshes!! This is so irritating. Please fix this to wear it only updates the Home Screen if you pull down the feed from the top for a second. Like Twitter. You can’t even scroll through the feed sometimes without it randomly updating. Also the ads Pinterest.. come on. They’re every third pin! I get you have to pay the bills but more often than not your ads are irrelevant to my search. Ads are not helping you. Pinterest was for curation, for creation. Not to be another soul sucking platform for over consumption. And, why is it that when I search one thing my home feed will suddenly be filled with that one search? I didn’t follow the topic, I didn’t follow a new board, I don’t care to see it on the home feed I have sort of curated myself. This has been a lot of complaints and my rating is low so that you get how irritated I am.. I love you Pinterest, rarely change.",

It’s extremely wild that this is happening and Pinterest are just ignoring people who are trying to get their attention to get their account back. I know it might seem like me and other people are overreacting but Pinterest is truly such a fun app, and having that taken away for no reason is so frustrating. This shouldn’t be happening and it should never happen. I know it could be a mistake by bot reviewers but bot reviewers should not be able to deactivate or suspend accounts. Bot reviewers should only be able to report their triggers to a human reviewer and let that human reviewer decide what’s actually happening. Overall this app is amazing but this is the only thing that vexes me, truly. (Sorry if there were any grammatical errors I’m kinda stressed out from this.)",

I do not need every object in an image outlined. I dont need the focal point of a painting outlined. This doesnt imrove the user experience in any way. This feature could already be accessed before with the little scissor and search icons in the bottom right of the pin, at least then it was in our control and we could choose whether or not we want it to pop up.\n   Ive searched up on multiple sites, looked to see if anyone else had this problem and apparently its been going on couple months now. It wouldn't be too bad if there was a way to turn it off but so far no one has found a lasting solution. Please fix this pinterest!

And I don’t my the pushing of influencers and suggested pins I just wish we would also be able to see the people we follow. Getting rid of the follow tab was a bad move.\nSecond, when I search for something it doesn’t show me pins based on what I search but rather it shows pins from topics that I’ve already looked at. \nAs a result, I’m less inclined to use pinterest, because it just doesn’t function anymore.

You don’t have to be experienced in marketing to understand that frustrating and ignoring the needs of your audience is actually gonna cause you to lose money as a company, because people will just end up deactivating their accounts if they haven’t been auto-banned already. Just from taking a few minutes to read through the r/pinterest subreddit I found so many people who are struggling with the exact same things I am. And I mean HUNDREDS of people talking about how completely normal, safe, appropriate pins they’ve saved have been removed because, guess what, ai can’t correctly or accurately tell the difference between normal/sfw and explicit/harmful content. Not that the CEO cares though since he’s been deleting people’s comments with complaints on Twitter. If things don’t change for the better, chances are Pinterest will lose a lot of users and therefore lose revenue from getting too greedy, which I’d hate to see because I used to love the platform.

Sometimes I will get so frustrated with the ads that I will stop using the app in that moment. My home feed is probably 40% recommended pins and 60% ads. If you want to swipe to look through pins, you will come across these ads that have a carousel of images within the ad so you have to swipe nearly six times before you can go back to looking at pins. It is really annoying how Pinterest used to be a nice, aesthetic, simple app but now you are bombarded with ads the moment you open the app. It was honestly really disappointing how there is an excessive amount of ads popping up when I just want to scroll through my home feed, but I keep getting ads for brands that don’t even relate to what I am remotely interested in or looking at.

Seeing people try and recreate crafts and projects or funny reaction pictures feels like it was the point of the comment sections- to discuss the pin. Long story short it’s a feature that shouldn’t have been removed. Aside from that, the updates to the comment sections as a whole haven’t been my favorite. The new “react” feature seems a bit pointless; in the past you could like a comment and it was simple. There was a number of people that liked it and a heart lit up when you liked it. The new feature not only shows other people’s reaction in color- it only changes to “loved” or “helpful” in a dull color, which makes it really hard for people with poor eyesight, dyslexia, etc to discern which comments they have reacted to (since they are already in color) The helpful option as opposed to the loved option makes sense, but it seems more trouble that it’s worth.

Usually I’m able to click on the pin with no problem since the pins, which you’ve looked at that appear in the home feed tuner are able to be looked at only when they have a -checkmark- in a box next to the compact pin next o all the others which have the same. RECENTLY, it has not been working as something to look at for a history tool because I cannot look at my pins I have clicked on because the box with has the checkmarks automatically placed in them have all my pins hidden, so I CAN’T LOOK AT THE PINS FREELY WITHOUT RE-CHECKING THE BOXES MANUALLY, MAKING IT KICK ME OUT OF THE HOME FEED TUNER SECTION AND UPDATING MY FEED WHEN ALL I WANTED TO WAS TO LOOK AT THE PIN. I used the HFT as something I could see a pin I clicked on before the Pinterest refresh could get to it. Now, when I try to see any pin I have to check in the box myself, making it tune my feed so that I see less pins like the one I checked in just so I could see it closer. Hopefully I could get some help on this topic so it could go back to being browsing history for me.",

              "review": "I have been using Poshmark for several years now and have been very pleased for the most part. The few issues I have encountered have been met with overall good customer service. \nI was pleased when they began to offer various shipping fees (4.99, 5.95, & 7.11), as I agree with what many others have said, that since the market for USED and AFFORDABLE clothing is the main focus of this app, a $7 shipping fee can often be the price or near the price of the item you are buying. \nA suggestion would be to fix the categories people filter, shop, and create listings by. As an example, the women’s dresses category has numerous subcategories that are varying descriptors of a dress. Mini, maxi, one shoulder, long sleeve, strapless, et cetera. But what if you have a one shoulder maxi dress? Or a long sleeve mini dress? Which category do you select? I believe changing these categories to be more cohesive would make it much easier and less confusing for people to find what they are looking for. \nFor example, instead of all these random subcategories, perhaps all the subcategories could pertain to the same aspect of a dress. Like the subcategories are mini, midi, maxi. Or sleeveless, short sleeve, long sleeve. \nI believe that could greatly improve how quickly and easily shoppers can find what they have in mind using the filter tools.",

So in general it looks like supposed to be easy to list items and work with this app, but… One listing never can be posted and error appears saying “this listing cannot be edited cause item being purchased by a user” ?! I never ever was able to post it in the first place! And whatever I tried to do the error is a same. \nThen problems with listing similar items - I was able to list my item similar to other seller. There is a button “sale the dame item”. But when I want to sell same items from my store then comes the problems. First of all I didn’t find this button, so I went to Edit my item and then you can copy it. No, it didn’t let me and gave me all the time same error. Doesn’t matter if I refresh or so… So I went to another similar item, but I need to change a photos. Then there are no options to delete the photos, but option to replace - but one by one! Then somehow I was able to add more photos and “delete” option popped up… \nEvery photo you upload to the listing is goes magnified so the total view is cutting the rest of item… you need to adjust every photo one-by-one and control how they will appear. I do my photos of merch in a good scale which is goes with every app, but here some difficulties developing a hard time for sellers.\nSo far for 3 days of using I already contacted support twice…",

I love it because you get to see so many different fashions and styles and also the categories we get to use now like Home, Electronics and the toys categories and always making new ideas and striving to please their customers and having us poshers succeed to our full potential. I also love it because you get to see and speak with so many different kinds of people which is a great idea. Poshmark is easy to sell your items and also buy different and unique items. Poshmark does take time to sell your items and add items to Posh parties that what brings you potential customers. In order to make money you have to put in the effort. Poshmark allows you to put your items in parties and other social media and that is great because it gets your products out there to the people that might not know what poshmark is. To me poshmark is one of the best websites and apps I have ever been on and I have learned a lot and have sold quite a bit which is made me proud to be with them and to make money. I appreciate the income tremendously and poshmark so much! 👗👚👖👒🛍 Thank you so much for the opportunity! I wish you guys the best and the wonderful success for years to come!

There are definitely some bad sellers out there as well as scamming buyers, but the ratio of good to bad is slim. Before purchasing, I always check for Love Notes (reviews), what their ship time avg is, and if they’ve been active recently. I’ve had nothing but good purchases from Doing so! Also if something ever goes wrong as far as not getting the right item or item is damaged, you can always open a case and return and/or get a refund. The one thing that ticks me off about posh is the amount of junk & replicas being sold when they are clearly either not allowed or illegal! And we as sellers/buyers are the ones who basically have to get them removed. I wish posh had more security and was able to instantly remove listings that are unallowed. This is a clothing/accessory/shoes/new, not swatched makeup platform ONLY. I wish they would do more to keep it so! Its also really frustrating when I’m trying to find something from a certain brand and there are so many items from a different brand mistagged for “exposure”. I could report them all, but that would take months! There are so many unallowed listings and rules being broken and they need to do something about it besides having us sort through them in our own time at no cost.",

Just make sure you ask all your questions and request pics until you’re confident you want to buy since there are no returns (except when something has been blatantly misrepresented).\n\nSelling, on the other hand, has downsides that are the flip side of the same coin. People make ridiculous lowball offers. For example, say I’ve used a $200 handbag just a few times but then for whatever reason need some cash. I list for $100 which is a fair price and very good deal (keeping in mind I won’t be getting the full $100 anyway), and someone comes in offering $40. It’s just insulting and a waste of my time and I don’t even want to bother negotiating. This obv isn’t the app, but worth mentioning because it’s part of the overall Poshmark experience. I’d say the vast majority of buyers behave like this. Out of every 25 transactions, probably only 1 is a straight up purchase at listed price. Plus, you have to put a LOT of work into keeping your items visible and be super active on the app.\n\nBut the worst part about selling is the 20% fee. I’ve ended up making $2 on an item before. The best part about selling is how the shipping label is just emailed to you so you can just pop the item into the drop box. Honestly not sure I would do this over again - I’d look into other apps for sure.",

The response time is within the next day and they are so awesome in explaining and/or correcting problems. They have always corrected all the problems i have had and then some. Customer support is so important in an app like this where money and transactions are constantly involved. So kudos to the whole Poshmark team! \nFew suggestions:\nThere are few things that would make the app better, nothing that would demote the 5 stars I think this app deserves. One would be to be able to pick the shipping weight. $7.11 flat shipping rate is a lot, especially when most of the buyers are buying single clothing items that do not cost the $7.11 to ship. It doesn't make much sense. And another thing would be to report users for manipulating tags. There are so many boutiques that add popular brand tags in their posts so when you search for that brand, all of that boutiques clothing is something you have to scroll through. Its fairly annoying, and its not right. These boutiques are taking away from us who are just trying to sell one thing at a time. The search feed becomes a mess from them. They shouldn't be able to spam every one of their posts with the tags.",

              "review": "8/4 Review:\nThis app still needs work. The notifications are so chaotic! There should be separate tabs for Offers I’ve made on other sellers’ items vs. Offer made on items in my own closet. Same for Comments – it’s so hard to follow the comments I actually care about, and I often miss replies or questions specifically for me. At this point, I rarely sell on Posh anymore, as Mercari is just a better experience all around. I still maintain that Posh needs to figure out a lower shipping cost for lower-weight items such as most jewelry, perhaps with value tiers (eg I’d ship something precious at a higher cost than costume). I also really like the Promote feature on Mercari, where you can promote your listings by dropping their prices. \n\nPrevious Review:\nJust read the reviews. I’m not alone. There’s almost no real customer service. I definitely spend way more than I make on Posh, but a recent selling experience combined with the disgustingly high shipping costs has me seriously reconsidering using this app in the future. Shipping costs should be tiered based on item. A pair of stud earrings should absolutely never cost $7.11. It’s stopped me from many purchases. Also their cut is way too high on lower-priced items. But ultimately it’s the lack of seller protection or support that are finally driving me away. Buyers can cancel sales hours later for no real reason, and that’s just allowed with Posh. Nope!",

When I try to make an offer to a liked on a particular item it says it wasn’t sent to any likers and that I need to lower the price. Usually i have to make several tries at lowering the price because I don’t remember what amount I previously offered. It shows you a history of your offers only after a successful offer goes through. I love the app aside from the 20% poshmark takes and I wish there were certain days or events where they could lower it to 10% for a specific time period. Also I wish they would make closet clear out less confusing. I still don’t know how it works. I don’t know if I’m supposed to make an offer to likers or just edit the item price to receive discounted shipping. I also wish it would show us the discounted shipping poshmark covers for closet clear out, or at least show a timer left to sell that item. Lastly I wish there were more incentives for parties. I’ve had a few items chosen for host picks but that never helps me. It feels like parties are just a place for sellers to list their items without the presence of many buyers. Maybe poshmark could offer discounted shipping on host pick items or some type of incentive.",

(Considering that these are all my unworn clothes or slightly used clothes that I was going to give away) it was very impressing. I have all 5 star reviews! But, the one thing is Poshmarks fee is pretty high. If you sell something for $10 you only get $7.05. Or, $100 you only get $80. So it is a 20% fee. I have found other apps that don’t have a fee like this app Vinted, but when I sell something it wants my Social Security number, so don’t get that app by the way. However another thing Vinted has us where you can chose how heavy what you are shipping will be, so you don’t have to pay 6.99 for shipping after your first purchase. I think Sellers should be able to chose the weight so buyers don’t have to pay so much! But other than those two minor improvements Poshmark could make I absolutely love the app and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying, or selling on this app. It is completely secure and doesn’t ask for you social like that Fraud app Vinted. And has a buyer return policy, so if you don’t get what you were supposed to then you get your money back! Anyways, definitely get this app and check it out!",

This isn’t a surprise or something you find out later on.  I am a buyer and seller and have had no problems with the app or their Customer Service! I bought wholesale items from two different sellers that came damaged upon arrival and PM customer service has been great taking care of the problems. Poshmark is a great app to sell clothes you don’t wear anymore and don’t want to sell at a Yard Sale. Yes, you may get $2 for that item, but it beats $.25 at a Yard Sale! And you can always delete the listing and SELL them at a Yard Sale! As a seller, you decide what to sell items for. There will always be low ballers, but you can always deny the offer or counter the offer! I like the options you have as a buyer and seller. And if there’s something shady going on, you have the option to report it. I think Poshmark is great and getting better with every update. If you have a problem, let PM know. If you don’t like how they do things, that’s up to you to get another app to sell on. PM is a very good app and it’s been a great experience overall. 🙂",

Never in a million years did I think I’d love selling clothes or even meet some of the greatest people, on a clothing application. It’s indescribable. It’s so much fun. It really is. You have to try it to believe it. It’s not complicated. It’s not overwhelming. You sell something and poshmark emails you the shipping label. You print the label slap it on the box and drop it at the post office. That’s it. How much easier can it get?  And I’ve met more people on poshmark than instagram. It’s a positive environment. I remember getting my first package from my first purchase and inside the box there was a thank you note from the seller.  Something that simple made the whole experience feel like I was getting something from a friend. Not a stranger. I’m not the clothing app kind of person. I never would have thought I’d enjoy something like this over my social media apps. But I do. I love it!  Just try it. You’ll see what I mean.",

              "review": "I am not a fan of them not using other options for shipping carriers other than usps, they are the worst and my last few transactions have been more than delayed by just a few days even though I go out of my way to drop off same day. Some days I drop off in after hours box over the weekend hoping shipment will track first thing next business day. To my surprise, this isn’t the case on many occasions and sadly this effects avg. shipping time which you need to maintain as a PM Ambassador. In addition, it seems like PM reviewers dealing with disputed shipments aren’t equipped to review claims of fakes or counterfeits….even those that have been reposhed and sold on their own platform. They will usually side with seller without really trying to objectively review claim buyers make. They should ensure that all luxury items be authenticated before being able to post them or offer to authenticate them like other platforms instead of docking seller who reposhes an alleged fake item from another PM seller. There are many who lowball and have bot accounts but I believe they are being dealt with more often now so that’s a good sign. PM Fee is a little too high for me but it is what it is….\n\nOther than that, they respond to concerns fairly quickly and are helpful with other concerns that may arise. It’s been a good way to make some extra money for me on the side.",

I have so many clothes, never have I gotten rid of anything in the past 30 years, some of it is 30 years old with the tags on it still! It’s too valuable to me to just donate to the Goodwill and when you do something like have a garage sale or go to a consignment shop, you usually only get a few bucks at the most for something. So with nowhere to go with it, I’ve hung onto it for years. One night while trying to figure out what to do with an old jacket that was valuable, I had the idea to put it on Poshmark. I had recently found out Poshmark was free to list items and this is why I went with Poshmark. I posted the item and in the morning it had sold for $100!! So then I did it again with two more items, and the next morning, those were sold also! So I’ve been doing it for two months now and I’ve made over $2000, I have hundreds of items on there and this is the perfect platform for my things! I wish I knew about this sooner but I’m just happy to have found it when I did! I’ve also rotated out my current wardrobe and I’ve gotten an entire new closet full of clothes! Where has Poshmark been all my life?!?!",

              "review": "I love poshmark and I’ve been an avid buyer and seller or “posher” since 2017. However there needs to be updates made to the app. For example, if you click on a listing it will tell you the date and month that it was posted/ updated but it won’t tell you the year. Meaning the post could have last been updated on say “June 24th 2015” but it will only say “June 24th”. Also, there should be a rule or something that requires poshers to update their listings every two weeks or so. Half the time I’ve bought a product and I’ll have to wait a week for the order to automatically cancel b/c either a.) they didn’t update it /haven’t been active for weeks, months, years, or they just no longer have the item and never tell you. My second complaint, is that I feel that poshmark cares more about the buyers than the sellers and that’s not fair. I feel like poshmark sends many reminder emails about making sure to ship out a product, but they don’t do the same to the buyers when it’s time for them to rate the purchase in order to complete it so the seller can get paid. Poshmark doesn’t release the funds until either the buyer rates and confirms the delivery or if they don’t do that within three days , poshmark automatically does it for you but why should I have to wait three days? It’s inconvenient and inconsiderate.",

Honestly finding Posh again opening the App I started crying such growth in the business so many people all the New information. I have been addicted admiring, shopping and making plans on how to really clean my closet So all my beautiful things can get some love.

May this App continue to inspire and give back to all of the wonderful ladies who strive so hard to be the best part of Great Women at every corner. Mom’s, CEO’s, Wife’s,Business owners we ladies own this spectrum. Remember every piece that is put out for us was once a special item that was needed or admired or a must have for an occasion. A lot of times these very items carry great memories and even shoppers remorse. Not anymore those items will live on and actually give back a second time and we super women can keep dressing and doing all that makes us the best and know down deep there is a posher Waiting to share in your new purchase!!",

The problem is that the website now loads only eight items at a time. When you scroll down you get a message that says “loading more” and after a few seconds another eight items will load. The slowness is frustrating enough, but the biggest problem is that after so many scrolls and “loading more” messages the screen will go white and then throw you back at the top of your closet. You now have to start all over again. It’s very frustrating and has made browsing and sharing nearly impossible. I am now starting to list on other platforms because without being able to share my closet, my sales have dropped significantly. I wrote support multiple times. I normally received prewritten responses. I finally received a response from a developer and they temporarily changed things back, but after about a week it went back to the new system of loading only eight items a time. I loved Poshmark, but this system “update” has made it almost unusable from a sellers standpoint and has forced me to start listing on other sites. Very disappointed.",

It’s like walking in to a high end thrift shop but brands like Coach and Louis Vuton are much more worth the purchase as the prices are Dropped! Only thing I would change is it’s very hard to navigate between your offers/bundles/likes/shares/sales/follows... they said they changed that so it be easier in the last update however I don’t think it was made for an iPhone sxmax or an iPad 6 yet. Posh Ambassador program is cool I just wish we took on more responsibility with Posh after all we worked our tail off to get here we obviously love Posh! Also Customer Support is very much slow, as a seller with someone who already placed an order and the buyers shipping label won’t print cause their address is wrong, and you keep loosing out on selling! I think there should be some sort of direct contact with Posh Support like a number or something for customer service... because the longer we wait to ship our shipping rating goes down, and that is just not cool! Other than that I absolutely am in love with Poshmark and highly recommend it for both people who love to shop and for people who love to sell! I highly recommend this app!!!",

              "review": "I initially thought Posh was a fun way to sell on line but the high fees and shipping rates are a problem.  I have literally received 5 cents from selling items for $3. Once the item is below $10 then the minimum Posh fee of $2.95 becomes greater than 20%.  Additionally, it’s hardly worth paying $6.49 in shipping fees for inexpensive lightweight items.  I think this structure needs to be revised. As a seller, I basically give away stuff; regardless of how low I price merchandise, the offers come in ridiculously (insultingly) lower where I often prefer not to sell.  As a buyer, the items I like are marked up above what I see in retail (or they are not bargain shoppers and grossly  over paid from the start). The constant promotions just encourage us to continue marking stuff down with no benefits.  I don’t think the application is easy to use as I would like to be able to look at the sellers stats before a purchase to assure quality.  I did appreciate the free authentication of items above $500.  Additionally, sellers must stay alert to constant scammers. I don’t think I will continue to do this much longer. \n\nThere should be more avenues to provide feedback, like themes for Posh parties like: White Party Attire (all white items), Game Day (jerseys and sports paraphernalia), Plus size parties, High Cotton (only 100% cotton), etc.  I think requiring the fabrication as listed on labels is important.",

You post clothes you no longer need or want at a reasonable price and someone will buy them. Wonderful. Now I have room in my closet and a little money for shopping. The app was bare bones. You scroll through and what you see is what you get. Then people started using this as a job just to make money. They’d buy clothes from thrift stores and mark them way up. People post items very visibly worn or damaged. There should be a quality standard. There should be better controls about price gouging. There should be better controls around mistagged items. There are items listed as a certain brand or style for views, but photos show the item is not as described. Poshmark then opened it up to children’s and men’s clothing. Then they changed the scrolling and would show the same items again and again. Then they started adding “promoted” items which means your search results are now riddled with nonsense that you have zero interest in. Every 2 rows there are “promoted” items. Let me search for what I want, show it to me once, and don’t fill my results with anything else I am not specifically looking for. All of these issues make poshmark a huge waste of time. The developer doesn’t care about user experience just keeping people scrolling. Next they’ll start showing ads.",

I know this because I’ve played this level at least eight times trying to get first place, but I couldn’t... It isn’t the case that I’m bad at the game, because I’m actually fairly good at it. I know this because whenever it would come to votes, it’d be the same exact girl dressed in the same thing only with the name changed. I know I’m probably playing against a computer, but it makes me so angry that I tried so many different styles and the score would be the exact same. I’d get a 7.5 and the person, with the same outfit each time would get a 10. I even went out of my way to dress the exact same as the “girl” I was going up against to see if I’d win, and I still lost. I don’t know if this is a glitch, me playing against a computer, or if it is just a huge coincidence, but it should be fixed to where if you are playing against a computer that the score would at least change to where you could win! I’ve noticed this with a couple other levels as well. I did my research, haha! Other than that huge issue with the multiplayer mode, I really do enjoy playing this game. I truly enjoy the fact that you can watch ads to get items instead of spending money on coins, so I thank the creator very much for doing that and producing a very great game!",

Why is it that at the end of each play you have a choice to double your score if you watch a video. Well don’t you think that option should be working if you are giving players that option and also why are you giving the option to watch multiple videos and then if you take advantage of that option you are only allowed to watch some and not all of them. For example, if at the beginning of a play you may want to buy a certain outfit but you don’t have enough coins for that outfit well you may have to watch 5 or maybe 6 videos on some but you can’t watch them so because you don’t have the coins and you can’t watch the videos you only have the option of choosing what you don’t want. You’re not making this fun for us gamers by having all of these problems. I have turned 8 of my girlfriends on to this game and every last one of them  are already talking about deleting it. I also agree with an earlier review. I can choose the exact same outfit as my opponent and my outfit bombs and hers will get a straight 10. Glitch or coincidence. You need to do some major updating and or maintenance. Well I didn’t want to even say it but I will be deleting this game from my gaming list. Such potential with this one but until you fix this I’m not gonna waste time on it.",

But I have been experiencing major glitches, including kicking me out completely of the game taking me to my home page of my iPad and making me refresh the level. Also once I reached level 19 I completed the level and it gives me my score. I then take a break from the game for a minute, and when I come back to play the next level it tells me I have not completed the level prior. And takes me to level 19 again to complete before moving on. I have done this level now 5 times. When I get to the screen where you get the results I am able to click on the button to take you to the next level so I was able to play level 20 and I completed it, but then When I go to the home page where all of the levels are located, it tells me level 21 is locked. Very frustrating! I do think it’s great that you give a option to watch videos to purchase the items, although there has been glitches while watching and kicks me out of the game. Thank you and I’d appreciate any feedback or help you could give to help me figure this out. Please fix glitches so I can continue to enjoy your lovely game. Thanks again!",

Majority of the items in the store cost more than what you can get for watching two videos which could give you 1000 each time you watch one. Meaning you would have to watch a series of ads before you can purchase an entire new outfit. Not only that, up until a certain point the reward after the stages are only a fraction of what you can actual buy in the store. \nYou can basically put on whatever because as long as you pick items that need to be bought either with coins or with videos, and select the items with “hot” and “perfect” under them you get a good score. \n\nIt didn’t occur to me that I could watch videos solely to earn money so it took me a while to get to the style challenge portion which in whole was a huge waste of time and was the only reason why I didn’t delete the app then and there. I was under the impression that it would be a challenge with you and other people who played the game, but no it’s just the computer again. There isn’t even any excitement in the judging. The time limit is a bit dumb but could potentially be a cool concept if it was rational. The “tallying up” or the judging part is a two second process which only advocates for my earlier claim and is just downright underwhelming. It’s the same thing as the other challenge but with a time limit.",

Every app I looked at wasn’t good enough, but I knew this was the one when I saw it. It was perfect. I would suggest this app to anyone who loves fashion. The only complaints I have about this app is adds internet and play ability. Adds were only a small problem for me it doesn’t make me love the app less or more. I just wish there was less. Internet is something I wanted because I don’t have cellular on my iPad . For some people internet isn’t a problem because they have cellular but I just wish that was something that the game didn’t require. Next is play ability. That basically means how much you can play. I loved this app so much that I finished everything within one vacation. I wish there would’ve been more to play. I was so disappointed that I deleted the app. I missed it so much that I re download the app. Now that is something that I really have a problem with. It’s still an amazing app those are just my wishes. Thank you for reading my review.",

Sometimes I can get a little boring if I play too long but other than that it’s pretty entertaining and I really like how it recommends things I asked you to say because I like says perfectAnd like other stuff.I can style people and I get these amazing things and a lot of things don’t cost real money and if you don’t wanna spend real money you can just watch ads I mean nobody likes ads but since I’m only 11 that’s really all I can do. I do really love this game though and I think it’s just so much fun and there’s all of these like I know that they’re not called adventures but in my personal opinion I kind of think they are because like there’s weddings beach parties job interview dates there’s so many different occasions and I love that there’s so many different choices for tops bottoms dresses hairs accessories all that stuff and everything is not that expensive and I also really like that you can have a closet. I also don’t ever have any technical issues him and if like the connection is ever bad it’s always the Wi-Fi so that’s a good thing but yeah I do really enjoy this. Over all I only have one complaint which I obviously already mentioned so yeah I do definitely recommend this game and you should try it out!😃😁😋😍",

The outfits are excellent and I would love to wear them in real life and look as pretty in them as the characters I design in the game. However, there is one slight issue. I know you might have gotten many reviews about this but there are SO MANY ADDS! Its just so frustrating that I have to watch up to 8 adds just to get a plain red shirt! Its kinda ridiculous. It is very hard to enjoy a game when u have to watch like up to 8 adds for every single piece of clothing or accessory or background. Even when I'm trying to play the next level, it gives me an add. Pls just fix the issue so the game is much better. My little cousin has this game and she plays it in the hour that she has for screen time and literally, half the time is basically adds. Pls fix this issue so the game is much more fun. Other than that, the game is so great. Great job designing the game. It would just be better with less adds. Thank you for reading this response. I hope you will take my suggestion under consideration. Great job!",

Flaw #1 it’s prices to buy outfits r pretty expensive for starters. When I started it was like 2000 coins to buy shoes and another 2000 to buy a necklace! Which is not worth it. Another flaw is you cant change the profile pic. Which makes me so mad!!! I hate mine it looks nothing like me!!! And I wanna change it so bad!!!! Please change this!!! Or just upgrade it! The last flaw is that.  We need a upgrade new hair-do or like more makeup and accessories and hair. I am done with the flaws now I wanna add the good things about this app! I love that if your competitive you can go against ppl! And if you don’t want to go against ppl you have a choice! Another great thing about this app. That there is categories! The last thing I wanna say is that I hope I didn’t offend anyone or hurt someone’s feelings. Another thing I wanna add is please fix these flaws and make this game better!

I literally got this game less than a week ago, and I finished all the events now it’s just that app that I play when I am bored with my other apps. It’s pretty boring to me now. Also I wish there was a mode where you could just dress up and choose your own thing to do instead of you having to be forced to do the other mode. What I also don’t like is how when you are about to submit, but you have no time left, you basically have to put in the 100 coins just so you can submit if you literally are done but have one second left. But it was pretty fun when I got it. But I am just wondering if they will ever put in any more modes and levels so I can still play. Also I am so mad. I went into the app, and discovered some of my fave items were missing and replaced with other items. This is not fair, and it should be fixed. I am so unhappy that some of my favorite things went missing and it makes me so mad at this game. Oh an btw in the video you watch it shows stuff that doesn’t show up and I am so mad that it deleted the clothing that I PAID FOR. I also have items that said HOT or PERFECT that are missing. It is so angering to actually go on a game and find out that a lot of stuff is replaced and missing and it’s sad that this happened to me.",

One of the things I wish they didn’t change was, after every level e used to have three pictures of popular designs for inspiration. I didn’t even mind that it crashed occasionally. But then after the new update I couldn’t even get in to the app! This is one of my favorite games but now I can’t even access it! It just crashes every time I try to open it. And before you say “oh are you connected to WiFi?” Or “oh make sure there are no apps running in the background” or “oh make sure you’re updated to the latest iOS update” I AM connected WiFi the best spot for WiFi. I CLOSED all the windows running in the background. And I JUST updated my phone last night.  The only thing I can think of right now is to uninstall then reinstall the app which would make me lose all my progress! Developers please fix this. Please let me use my favorite game.",

Pick anything farthest to the right and the rating goes down. Pretty simple and doesn’t allow me to be creative. All the models are the same skin color but you can change the skin color. I wish the models were pre -selected without the option to change their skin color. I wish the models came in several different skin colors, body types and sizes, Without the option to change. I also wish they’d remove the “hot” and “perfect” labels and mix the clothing selections in a way that you could pick a 5 star rated dress but find it randomly within the other selections. I love the value of the coins and the amount you win back from challenges. It keeps my coins pretty high for a long time. Very good Value! But I’m not interested in picking from what’s already pre -rated as “hot” and “perfect”. It lacks rewards and statistics. Can we have a daily board listing the highest rated stylists? Some sort of user community?",

It even lets you double your prize money if you watch an ad, which is a great way to get gamerich lol. I like to play this game to keep my mind calm; I find it soothing and easy. Except the pvp challenges, those I play to win, not to relax 😂 \n\nMy only complaint: game needs more hairstyles for natural hair. They have of great options for straight brown or blonde hair and some mildly wavy or curly hair, but nothing cool like braids, dreadlocks, fros, etc. Kind of silly given that \"She\" has a darker complexion half the time. \n\nSuggesion: It would be cool if you could pick a hairstyle, and separately choose her hair color & type. I'd love to put \"Her\" in a ball gown with swirly hombre braids all piled up in a great bun, or add some cornrows to one of her athletic ensembles. Give natural hair a chance!",

I love this game so much that when I get home from school, I go straight to my room to my iPad. Very little people that play this game notice what a spectacular game it is. Here are some of the things that make it great: #1: the animations. The animations are so smooth and also the graphics are, too. #2: I like the way they have different people to style.

But only if someone hasn’t chosen an add in a certain amount of time, say 72 hours, then you can have a pop up ad. But otherwise I say you should change the pop up ads. But besides all of that, the game is really fun I love the clothes and the makeup and everything. I also think you REALLY should add more hair color options. That would make the game even more fun. Overall this game deserves a 5 star rating and I recommend it because it is definitely not one of those babyish games. It is definitely fun and mature and more complicated but in a good way. I recommend this game a lot and y’all should totally get it 😁",

This game is marketed to 4+ on the app store, however I do not believe the ads reflect that age, even up to teenagers. While watching my granddaughter navigate this game, I saw many ads that were for things of which she has no knowledge, interest, or ability to use. I do not understand why developers want to use ads that are not reflective of the age of its targeted players. It is a waste to put healthcare ads from some insurance company in front of a 6 year or a 10 year old or even a teenager.  Plus the ads are way too long and run across multiple screens which is confusing to younger players. Developers should pay attention to this when deciding to rate an app for young children or when choosing ad content for its 4+ players. Please do not reply with some lame response about how ads help you to improve the game and develop new ones or how a third party handles your ads and you have no control. It is your game and your name under which these ads play and the ad choices are a reflection of your brand, so you should have control. This review is not about any of that!",

I’m not required to purchase anything at any time to enjoy it. There are some ads in between game play but you’re not required to watch it in entirety unless it’s for a prize. I did buy a small batch of coins at the very beginning which multiplies itself when I win challenges or just get coins for filling the style diary which I can do literally over and over and over. The option to watch the ads in exchange for items is great because a lot of games don’t give that option and try to make you spend money for coins. My closet is huge because I watched a few videos and the hints of what looks are “hot” and “perfect” for the event helps me win the challenges. I can play this game for hours without running out of lives or events to dress for. Completely obsessed!!!",

So often one would like to express their own style and sense of fashion! Style is so individualistic.",

Make more Interesting levels or I won’t play anymore. Also the outfits are hideous. Like I can do better than that. 😒. And I have waited 6 months now for them to get new levels but there are none! But this experience has led me to finding another fav game! I need more levels! Yes they did steal my already purchased items for other ones! ITS BEEN 1 year since new levels. Guess it’s okay bc design home is waaaay better. They have new levels every day! As well as COVET FASHION!!  I also have a photo I would like to send- it’s me and my competitor in a styling competition but every single item is the same as mine except for the hair. Even the makeup. Me and my little brother want to have fun memories, but they turn out to be us just laughing at the outfit from my competitor that looked the same as me. I am truly just depressed because I can’t buy anything because some of the outfits are WWWWAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY to expensive. We shouldn’t have to spend our own- hard earned money on a fashion game.",

I recently had scored 4-5 10 out of 10’s so I was surprised when I saw my average points per challenge was a five. I don’t remember ever getting fives at all. So I went back and looked at each outfit and their individual score and was shocked to see that a good percentage of the outfit that had low scoring weren’t even mine. After all the hours I’ve spent watching advertising to be able to make beautiful outfits to find that my scoring and my outfits weren’t even mine kind of burns me up. So I’m writing to tell you can you check your scoring and your outfits frequently because they’re probably not accurately reflecting all your hard work. I love this game and now I don’t!

Why would a level 10 player go against a level 55??? The higher level of course is going to get the vote. Higher levels always do because they have the cool makeup or hairstyle. Work on this Covert! 2) Top Look/Perfect Score is usually always the high levels and all the looks-look the same. What happened to fashion being an expression of one’s personality. 3) Borrowing, again I strongly believe the team needs to review the rules and update them. Players who are in a Fashion House and have Friends should be allowed to borrow 1 item from each per outfit. Do a test run and see if we the players responded positively or negatively. 4) This is a pive of mine. Please y’all check your spelling and grammar. Most of the time I have to piece together words to figure out the challenge. 5) About challenges, if you ask the players to dress a nurse, you should provide scrubs as an option. That is just one example. I could literally go on. 6) Hair accessories should be an award, players should not have to spend $8.99 of our money. If you want to charge than players should be allowed to purchase with game money or diamonds. 7) A big pive of mine is being required to purchase jewelry on a challenge and because of the scene the earrings don’t even show. Other than the things I mentioned, the game is fun.",

I appreciate the little changes in diversity that the developers have added. But I feel that there should be MORE changes make to the game than just the appearances. For example, When I enter 28 challenges and won the months styling spree prize, it was out of season. I don’t think it’s fair to make this that way. I also believe when a new season starts and you have barely any money to spend on creating a whole new closet, you should get a welcome gift for each season to help start you off betterIt’s unfair to expect everyone to turn to their wallet for everything. I think you should get your tickets and diamonds at the beggining of the day instead of having to wait until evening to use them. You should be able to earn game cash more in challenges you have to buy things for, not just daily challenges. When I have voted on looks, I have noticed that they put very high level players against players almost 30 levels lower than them at times. I do not believe that this is fair to the players, I think it should at least be within the range of the player. If you read this, I think it’s worth playing the game, but just as well, there are definetly flaws that make gameplay not as enjoyable. Thanks for reading.\n\n*Abby B.*",

It makes sense that players that have been playing the game For seven years to win the top looks. I’m about a year and a half in now and grinding for my hair accessories in rallies and slowly learning how to get votes is what makes this game so addicting. Leveling up is rewarding because I’m given a even better competitive edge if I know how to use it right. I would hate it if I wasn’t able to compete against level 55 players even though I’m only Level 13. (Level 17 since I first wrote this review) Also I appreciate that they have best look in every level so that lower levels can see if they’re at the top within their level bracket.\n\nNote for developers: fashion houses are the best part of the game. But your lists of fashion houses are full of dead houses. I’ve seen so many succesful houses collapse after they were selected to be a house option from the quiz. Placing 6 new players or more in a house all at once puts too much strain and rallies are no longer achievable. Personally I think no more than 3 should be added In one placement session. Also searching for an active house on your own is nearly impossible. Please have search options for #of members and #of active members",

              "review": "I enjoy playing the game but, it is expensive. It’s quite frustrating that the diamonds are not able to be earned easily. The challenges, while offering diamonds as a prize, are quite difficult to climb high enough if you do not initially spend a lot of money to buy the stuff. It’s frustrating. Spending even just $10 for diamonds only gets a few challenges out of it as long as you don’t buy the most expensive pieces. It’s truthfully not the best way to treat the customers. Even the “earn diamonds” section where you can subscribe to stuff is a bit of a joke.  You do have the option of borrowing from someone in your fashion house but either your fashion house is hard core you need to enter every challenge, or there isn’t enough people to enter challenges or borrow from anyone. \nI don’t agree with the way the scoring is and how people are judged.  There can be a level 106 against a level 3.  There can be people who create a look completely inline with what the challenge requests but someone else will do better scoring wise in nothing related to the challenge at all. \nI do take a break from the game every now and again and still the complaints are the same. They have done a slightly better job being inclusive for diversity but most of the “diverse looks” are still pretty stereotypical.  Creating a look that’s “Asian” instead of honoring the various cultures and countries that make up that continent.",

It is incredibly frustrating for a couple of different reasons. 1) The voting system is terrible. Looks are voted on by other players, but sometimes a level 6 is pitted against a level 57 and there is literally no way someone just starting out could compete with the closet, hair, and makeup available to a level 57! I try to level the playing field by always voting for the one with the lowest-level hair. Someone with a gorgeous fancy hairstyle is probably a high level, whereas I can easily recognize the lower-level hairstyle. I know it’s not fair to judge this way, but I feel it’s the only way to give the newer players a chance!\n\nThe next thing is actually my biggest frustration with the game. When you first start off playing, you advance levels pretty easily—I want to say every $25,000 or $50,000 spent (of Covet money, of course! Not real money, lol). Then, once you reach a certain point, you only level up every $100,000. It makes the game a lot less fun for me. I’m not trying to spend a ton of my own money, which I’m sure many of the higher-level people do (I always imagine them as housewives who don’t work but have an unlimited amount of money to spend on an app), so it takes foreverrrrr to level up. any other complaints are minor, but if these two things were fixed, the game would be almost perfect.",

Especially since they have two different modes that allow you to dress different sizes its quite nice and refreshing. I see a lot of copycat versions and they dont look as appealing as this one. If you dont like spending money dont play this game. If you take things too seriously...dont play this game. If this is a career rather then just for fun..you really shouldnt play this game. This game should be for fun and being able to vote on other outfits, be in houses to share clothes and tips, and just all around having fun dressing up. The reason for the five stars. 1. very easy for me to get around on the game. 2. you can level up without spending just takes longer🤷🏽‍♀️. 3. even with maintenance they usually make out for that in some type of way. regardless of how others whine and complain. 4. its something to do when i have some time. 5. its fun and calming.

Someone who is at level 46, has a closet that is worth $3.7 million dollars. The more items in your closet, the higher the value of your closet.  The more items you have to chose from, the better your results.  So how is it fair, to put a level 12 next to a level 46, and have voters choose the best look?  Clearly the odds are in the favor on the person who has more items in their closest. Obviously the person who is a higher level is good at design, so it’s not like that they got there by luck. If you are going to have voters choose, put a level 12 against a level 11 or 13, maybe a 14.  I think they are aiming to get people to buy more diamonds to add things to their closest, because you pretty much have to buy more to get to the higher levels.  Also, to get things like tiaras and veils (they have bridal challenges), you have to be at the higher levels AND pay $9 to unlock them.  I decided to try one design with a tiara, and a similar design on another without a tiara.  The one with a tiara got a 4.96 rating from voters. The one that didn’t, barely got a 4 rating.  Unblock a few more accessories or at minimum, give one vail, and a tiara like headpiece.  Or, don’t make people pay for every single hair accessory.  Get to the levels unlock the basic ones, and the more elaborate ones you can charge for.  Fix the uneven voting and I’ll change my rating.",

With the amount of clothing items plus the accessories, props, and head wear, it’s almost impossible NOT find something amazing. That’s why I can not seem to understand why the top looks in EVERY event look exactly the same. I don’t even have to scroll down because looks #1 through, like, #20 on the first page have the same dress, same hair, same props, same everything. Now, I’ve played the game long enough to know that yes, challenges have certain items that have to be worn. But there is still a HUGE variety of things to create. I keep coming back to the game because I love fashion, but I always stop playing because I don’t think it’s allowing people to be individual. Maybe our votes don’t count unless you spend money. But when a game doesn’t let you advance unless you spend money, it’s not really fun. Otherwise I would pay ONCE and then have all the closet items unlocked. Or have a monthly subscription or something. But I get so tired of seeing the exact same copy cat for top looks. And majority of the looks are actually the newest and/or most costly pieces. The thing about fashion is that it’s so diverse and different. That’s why you don’t see people walking around wearing the same pants with the same shirt, same hair style and color walking the same dog. I know you have the ability to switch it up.  Because when I’m voting, I see some different looks. Not a lot, but some.",

This is an issue because arguably the clothing is the most important, and secondly, hairstyles and props are dependent on your level. I’ve noticed the outfits will be the same or similar, but the higher-rated ones have more extravagant hairstyles. Since lower levels are judged against high levels, this is unfair like other reviews are saying. The game could be improved if these things were changed imo: 1. Divide challenges into beginners, intermediates, experts, and even a non-ranked challenge. 2. Include some challenges without props to increase focus on the core “fashion” aspect of the game. 3. Make items easier to get without paying real money. I don’t have any ideas to suggest for this, all I know is it needs to change. Due to the “un-worn” feature that calculates a bonus into your final outfit score, items are not encouraged to be re-used, so you end up buying a whole new outfit for each challenge. I appreciate the option to “reset un-worn” items with in-game cash to gain the bonus but truly, unless you are willing to spend $$$, these costs will quickly become a problem and make you eventually have to give up the game. This game is easily the best fashion design app and has so much potential, so I hope the developers implement some of the changes many of the reviews are talking about.",

I also wish they would add an ability to keyword search. Sometimes I know i’ve seen an item but i have to scroll through many years of products just to find it because the predetermined filters don’t include what i’m looking for. I also wish there was a way to purchase hair accessories or props without spending real money. I understand the app needs to make money but it’s a little frustrating because most of the top voted looks are decked out with hair accessories and props that I imagine most users don’t have access to because they are not willing to continuously spend $8.99 for each set of hair accessories or props. Even if it cost gems that would be better than money. I would address some of the problematic racial issues but I read a few comments before mine who summed those up perfectly. I can see where they’ve attempted to be more inclusive but there is definitely still room for improvement.

I think it’s unfair that lower level players like level 6 compete against higher level players like level 69.  There is no way to compete with higher levels and your score lowers because of that. I even tried spending money to get hair accessories, props and prior season clothes, spent a lot of money over the past couple of months (it’s embarrassing)and I still can’t keep up with higher levels. Plus if you spend money on hair accessories you only get access to one style on lower levels. It’s more suited for higher level players who have access to all the styles. It’s not right that I spend the same money as the higher levels $8.99 yet I don’t get the same access.  I’m not going to spend anymore money on a game that gives me an unfair advantage.  Also if you don’t have a lot of  closet money or diamonds, you’re low level etc you can’t compete in more than a couple of events a day. I have an issue with categories like nursing, political figures, business women being in inappropriate clothing like crop tops, sequin outfits, ball gowns and cocktail dresses that keep winning. Honestly some clothing options should be eliminated from certain professional categories.  Overall the game is fun and you get to be creative.

              "review": "I love this app so much. It is an amazing app, but like every good one, there is always a catch. You have to check the app almost every day to receive prizes and you constantly have to buy new clothing items. I you don’t have enough tickets, dollars, or diamonds to buy something or even enter a challenge, you therefore cannot enter the challenge. This has been a pain for me because when a challenge interests me, I am always having to check every little thing to make sure that I am able to do the challenge. You can join a Fashion House, which allows you to chat and ask opinions on an outfit or challenge. BUT. You need to always check your chat and participate because they can kick you out if f your fashion house. Another thing I don’t like is that it takes so long to get the results. I understand that when in voting it may take a while, but I think voting times should be closer to 4-6 hours. Waiting 18 hours for a mobile outfit is unrealistic. A suggestion to help this would be have a calculation process. It could help by additional points on an outfit, but also help the rating results being calculated during the voting. That way, the second the voting time is over, you get your results. Now, like I said, I love this app. There are many amazing things apart of this app. Don’t let the bad parts have a huge difference on you. Cover fashion really is an amazing game.",

Also it’s very easy to earn the money that you used to buy more clothes in this app. There’s a wide variety of dresses, bags, jewelry, and so much more. One thing that I would change is the part where you can speak to people in your fashion house once you complete so many challenges. It’s a little offputting having a kid talk to people in their houses. It’s a little dangerous to have your kid talking to people in your house because you don’t know who they are or what they look like. Other than that though I don’t see why it such a big deal. It’s a lot of fun to use there are many different things to choose from once again. I personally Love this app. And I think you will too! I give this a four star rating that one star was taking taken off because of the chat option I wish there was a setting to be able to turn that off. That’s the only thing I would change. Other than that it’s a great app and I hope you will get it. One thing that I forgot to mention, is that you get to vote on other peoples luxe for the category. Also if you update the app in a certain way there’s a big diverse amount of models and I love that fact about it. So I think that rounds everything up.",

I have barely gotten started and don’t even own any of half the categories and only have like 2 of everything else to chose from on level 3 which is impossible to qualify for the requirements of a 4 item challenge and have run out of game money. Both coins and diamonds are gone since you only get a couple thousand to start with and every item costs on average 500. The challenges don’t give any rewards and the glitches are terrible and annoying already. I am still too new to even join a style team to see what that is all about and I am stuck. This game has so much potential if only it worked and gave you money ever. It has been over 24 hours and literally there is nothing I can do to move forward without spending real cash on the game to buy stuff but if I do that it will only help for one look and the I’ll be right back stuck again so there is no point in continuing. Might as well buy the clothes in real life. This is no way to start a new player off. Don’t bother downloading or even attempting to play because it is a waste of time that will only frustrate you with what could have been years of styling and getting exposed to new fashion but they clearly don’t care about game play for new players just milking old ones for every dime.",

Covet does require some in app purchases but not so much that you cannot fulfill any design. If you like fashion or design they have A LOT of features and it’s buildable, way more so then when I first started playing. And if you’re not bothered by in app purchases, they really aren’t that much. \nThe designers of the game are also really hands on. They needed to do some tweaking with the game and had to have it shut down for a bit of time, which took away from some of the timed design looks people could have fulfilled and earned points on. So they gifted everyone the winning totals anyway when they were done with their updating. I’ve never experienced that with an iPhone game in my life. They do also give out random gifts periodically as a thank you for continuing to play their game and the customer support is quick and efficient. \nAs someone who detests in app purchase games, I honestly do not mind this one at all. I’m still easily able to go through many designs and fulfill many of the daily features. This is the longest amount of time I’ve spent on an app since downloading instagram.",

Everything is so expensive so I can’t really play the game the way I would like. I can only buy the cheapest options to meet the min requirements for competitions and with how expensive everything is I can only enter the daily challenge and maybe 1-2 other challenges. On top of that the prizes are hideous and hard to get. You need to be rated at least 4.0/5 stars to get a prize. I don’t get how the rating works either because I see people on level 5 getting put up against people on level 13 and 22. Of course someone at level 5 is not going to be able to compete with someone on levels way above them. You get $100 cash to enter competitions, but it’s cost soooo muuuch so you’re never really making progress. I can’t actually buy things that I want and find cute. You get boosts for using unworn and “in season” items but not by much. If you wear anything not in season you lose points which is absurd. \n\nBottom line items are too expensive, prizes are ugly and hard to get, and competitions are ridiculous all around. It’s not fun when you don’t get to spend your money on things you actually want, but instead have to buy the cheapest options to meet the min requirements to join competitions. Seriously why is a purse 1000+ cash or gems? Why is a $495 bracelet a requirement to enter a competition? \n\nNot fun",

It can be expensive, but it can be played on a budget and even “for free” if you don’t obsess with having everything.  \nThe reason I rate it below 4 stars is the many glitches and awful customer service.  They need more people answering questions but more importantly they need to make the players feel that the people who run the game care about the players.\nA recent major glitch caused an important feature of the game (borrowing) to fail. It meant that some players spent more money and others lost prizes because of the glitch.  Covet could have provided alternatives and made the burden less on the players (enabled limited in-house borrowing, loosened some requirements, increased the daily player payout temporarily or something else).  Instead they just kept going while players got more and more frustrated.  Then, with it was all over, they “gifted” all players with something that the most active players can’t use (They  gave “prop tokens” to people who already had all the props. And since there is a limit to how many tokens can be stored, anyone who already had that limit—because there were no props left to buy—just didn’t get the prize to use on another occasion.)\nI no longer recommend this game because you get invested in it but then you are constantly being frustrated by things that go wrong and the lack of responsiveness of the developers.",

There are some minor improvements I would recommend (although these conditions are probably intentional efforts to increase revenue for the game...but hey, maybe if we complain enough they will listen): 1.) have skill brackets where comparable leveled players compete in voting rather than grouping all levels together, which gives higher-level players the advantage because they have better hair/makeup options 2.) introduce a search feature, or more detailed category selections, to make finding garments easier. 3.) allow Covet cash to cover diamond purchases when diamonds are insufficient. 4.) allow hair and accessory packages to be purchased using diamonds rather than actual currency. 5.) make previously favorited/loved garments accessible when creating outfits so they can be easily retrieved and purchased without unnecessary efforts to locate them by scrolling through hundreds of other items. 6.) allow one borrowed item PER OUTFIT. 7.) allow shirts/sweaters to be layered over dresses....or really just layering multiple clothing items in general. People do it..it’s a thing. 8.)ALLOW MANUAL SELECTION OF BODY TYPES...please :) The rationale for the ‘modern body’ option (which randomly assigns you one...but it’s somehow always still Barbie thin?) is ridiculous.

Leveling up is important because with each new level you get new hair and makeup. Typically that scores higher. People vote on the looks. I am okay with higher levels being paired with lower levels because higher levels have worked HARD and put in their dues. The one thing that is weird for me is that some ppl vote for the tackiest looks thinking “more is more”  just because the doll is overflowing with props and tons of layers. I feel like a lot of tacky looks get voted higher than looks that actually look amazing regardless of level. I do wish there was a curve in the scoring also because I have made multiple 4.99 and 4.98 looks that I didn’t get 5 star rewards for. It’d be nice if Covet just bumped that up. Lol. I do love getting rewards and I love the $0.99 FB challenge packs. For how expensive the game is I think Covet could add in a few more incentives, and I do think they’re getting better at that. I’d love if every now and then they sold diamonds in bulk for a discounted price. Like a hundred thousand diamonds for a hundred dollars. That would give some people a real chance at leveling up! It’s a fun game, addictive, and super satisfying to play.",

Since I knew everything would be coming from china i didn’t expect anything to arrive quickly but I did already receive one item. It was exactly as described and I bought it for less than $2! The rest of my items I am watching carefully through tracking updates, I LOVE that they give updates every step of the way. Plus they will return my money if it doesn’t arrive by the original date they claimed I’d receive it by so I’m not sweating anything. For what I paid on the many items I bought, it’s worth the wait for these things to come all the way from china! I know someone who orders from wish all the time so I knew it wasn’t a scam, I’m not sure what most reviewers are complaining about. The app is awesome, it gives so many rewards, and the prices are unreal. Recently they stopped charging shipping on every item - which was totally understandable when they did since each item comes from a different store, and started charging only $2.99 flat rate shipping for almost every product as long as you spend at least $10. I hope this change is here to stay!! I noticed that most of my items are shipping in one box even though they are sold by lots of different businesses so they must have recently upgraded their shipping capabilities with new warehouses or something and that’s why they can now charge one price for all items to ship. I’m telling everyone I know to get this app!!",

Wish has so many pretty little things to look at and buy, that for a while you forget about all the problems of the world. It would take days to look at all the Wish gifts. Wish does everything they can to make sure you get your stuff and you get a notice of your whereabouts on your orders. The only problem I have is you always have that one gift that lingers behind, for few extra day. I have a problem with that. I don’t understand how stuff gets lost, it should be that if the seller don’t have it on hand they shouldn’t be able to advertise their gifts. I’m still waiting on my one little thing and I hope it comes, cause I rather have my order than a refund. I don’t like them refunds, I rather have my order. It’s very heartbreaking when, they send notice of refund to you. But I been ordering from Wish a long long time and one complaint out of 100 good things, that complaint small to the wonderful things I got from Wish. Happiness goes a long long ways. \nThank you For the Wish, I received ♥️edie😂",

It comes down to this, you’re usually paying less than $15 for most stuff so be mindful that you get what you pay for. I’ve had things that get delivered within a week and look exactly like the pictures and fit AMAZING and I still wear them. I’ve also had things that take 3 months to be delivered and look nothing like the picture and are such poor quality I throw it away. I’ve never returned anything because honestly I’m lazy and HATE returning things, even to regular stores. So I see it as, if it is delivered and I hate it, I’m only out a few dollars and the world will go on. The things I’ve had the best luck with: shoes (specifically sandals), bathing suits and lingerie/bralettes. I’ve bought multiple dresses and tank tops from here too and still wear them daily. I really really really recommend looking at the reviews on the item and see what others have to say about sizing and quality. If I see poor reviews I won’t buy it but if everyone raves about how soft and true to size a bra and underwear set is or how cute and comfortable a dress is, I usually take that as a good sign and buy it.

It’s definitely not your guy’s fault because it’s the bots not you guys but it has been very weird and also really unbelievable. 2nd thing is that it has come to the point...I think you guys scam sometimes, I have seen many videos that your guy’s products sometimes have been scams. It would be even better if you make the prices more up and sell the REAL working products instead of scamming. And remember, it’s not my fault if I listed any wrong things that I said you guys did.

Here’s an example; I ordered 2 of the exact same neck Bluetooth speakers same color and same company and I paid $26 for each speaker so that was $52 for 2 speakers then I had to pay $12 plus $12 for shipping on the 2 speakers so I wound up paying $64 for 2 Bluetooth neck speakers and shipping which I don’t understand why I couldn’t have just paid for 1 of the shipping because they mailed both of my speakers in the same package so the company made an extra $12 because they was not mailed separately they came together in the same bag and that really made me mad because they should have mailed them in 2 different packages since I paid for 2 shipping prices on them or they should refund me $12 for shipping it in the same package. But that’s wish for ya. \nAnother thing I don’t like it how long it takes to receive some items I ordered from the wish app. It takes at least 1 1/2 weeks or longer before u will get whatever you ordered so always remember if you need the item quicker then you might want to look elsewhere because it’s not gonna come quicker!",

I then returned to my Home Screen to look for some subwoofer speakers for my car, I was confused when the first few that I had clicked on had also said “Sold Out,” so I started clicking on every single one in the search. EVERY SINGLE ONE, “SOLD OUT,” so then I decided to try and get some customer service support where an automated system gave me a list of very broad options for what my problem was. I wanted to view the FAQ section so that I could see if this was a frequently occurring issue. Never was I directed to an FAQ page instead I was told it would be 2-3 business days to get a response from a representative. After reading other reviews of this app, I expect nothing more than a reply to this review saying “we are sorry about this, we hope you give wish another chance.” I will be back on it in a few hours to see if the problem has resolved but honestly I am pretty disappointed that there is no immediate customer service representatives to help customers. ):",

I checked my account settings and they did store my address and card information though which is weird if my order didn’t go through how did you save my information? I contacted customer support and they were no help 3 times they explained a time limit after I explained to them 3 different times I IMMEDIATELY checked out and the app didn’t load. I then lost the free gift offer because of this lag/bug in their app and they were no help to me to receive my “free gift” which I still was paying the shipping for... or even to give me an explanation as to why it happened, only saying the excuse of a time limit which doesn’t apply because as soon as I made my account and received the free gift offer I immediately checked out and the app endlessly loaded which cost me the free gift offer and never put my order through but somehow saved my card information.. Customer support needs to do a lot better, maybe actually read what is sent to them and try to help not give an automated message about a time limit which has nothing to do with the situation they were contacted about.",

Contacted Customer Support , here you are asked specific questions that doesn’t even comes close to what your problem is, so you try to make the best selection that may come close to your problem. You have to take pictures of the item with a ruler for measurement purposes.  After I went through all of this, Wish CS contacts me and says that the company correctly filled my order, therefore, my problem has been resolved.  No it’s not!!  If you read the return policy you have 30 days to return your item.  The policy says to go to consumer support and click on Return Form,  this does not exist, once you click on CS you’re automatically connected with a CS worker and from there on is just a menu of “possible” reasons to select from as to why you’re unhappy with your order.  Because the company sent my order correctly that’s it I’m done, there’s no way I can return this one item because according to them my problem was resolved.  I order two other items from Wish around May 10, 2020 and I still haven’t received them.  They pushed the delivery date back to June 14, today is June 15 still don’t have my items, they’ve pushed the delivery date back again, this time it’s July 4.  I may be stuck with a purse I can’t use and I may not ever receive my other items, but I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH WISH AGAIN!!!!!!!",

It forces you to click through options until finally at the end you can write your problem along with a photo of the item. Well when I tried to upload the photo, the app kept malfunctioning and wouldn’t let me upload it. It wouldn’t let me send the message without a photo, but it wouldn’t let me upload a photo. So I had no way to contact customer support with my issue. I tried another day to do it and it finally let me upload the photo but by then it said they couldn’t issue a refund because it had passed the timeframe. I tried to explain why I couldn’t send my request sooner but they didn’t care. They just kept sending me an automated response and closing my request without resolving the issue or acknowledging that the app wasn’t working. But lesson learned that I will never attempt to buy clothes on here again (or anything). But especially clothes. I normally wear an xl or 2xl but on wish even a 5xl is too small for me. Their clothes are a joke and they’re really cheap quality. I’ve gotten some earrings I like on the app but some of them have come broken. And I’ve ordered several things that never arrive. Plus the items really aren’t that cheap when you consider how much shipping you pay per item. They make you think it’s cheap and then charge a ton for shipping. So no, this website is not worth it and the customer support is terrible.",

You just have to be careful. \nTHEIR LIMITED LIMITED QUANTITY DEALS ARE A SCAM! Sorry for the caps but out of the 60 attempts to get an item during one of these deals, none, absolutely none, have gone through. I don’t understand why they do this as it just pisses the customer off. They do give you a refund but make sure your card company allows for several credits. This was fine print that I’ve never known about. My credit card company, that I’ve had for over 5 years, only allows 4 credits per day, and after that, they charge. So to clarify: I thought I was getting a deal, was very excited for the deal, but then found out it was false. They refunded me the $2. Since I’d bought 8 items at $1/piece, and $1 shipping for each, I was refunded my $16, then charge $10 for each of the 4 additional refunds. In other words, I paid $40 for items that I’ll never get. Because of this, I’ll stick to Hollar, overstock, and Zulilly. \n\nTL/DR: use this app sparingly, don’t expect to get what you pay for(and in cases of quality, sometimes you get exactly what you pay for). And you might end up losing money.",

When I used the talk to an agent option on the “having issues” contact support link, all I got were automated messages. I finally (I think) got in touch with a live person, after 20 minutes of sending the same message over and over, they said they couldn’t offer an alternative way to send the item back and that their site is having technical difficulties at the moment and I should try again tomorrow. I then asked for a customer service number and they stated “we currently do not offer that option.” I wonder why....probably because they would get bombarded with angry customers. I am pretty sure the return link isn’t going to work tomorrow either so I will either have to try to get in touch with another agent, or just not send the item back. I WOULD RECOMMEND EVERYONE NOT USE THIS COMPANY OR WEBSITE. Most of the positive reviews on this site have to be fake because they are a couple words of positive review. Very disappointed Wish, you shouldn’t be in business if you cannot offer the customer support needed to run a good company. I will be posting negative reviews wherever I can to warn people not to use this site.",

As of my use of wish right now I am satisfied except for the shipping stuff and a pricing issue. Shipping is irritating as all hell for a couple reasons 1~ shipping is way to expensive often times it's more pricy then the product selected and there is no discounts for shipping 2) shipping takes a really really long time for a lot of items and they change the shipping date on you too so when you try to contact a wish support agent about it they tell ya that if it's not received by xx-xx-xxxx (usually about 1-2 more weeks) then to contact them before a specific date to have the issue resolved. Now for the pricing issue I mentioned above, they false advertise the pricing on (not all but most) items they will say one price then they ask you to select your color or size when adding it to the cart then as soon as you select your choice 8/10 times the price changes and you can't find the product for the price it was originally set at for the product. Besides these things I am satisfied with my experience using wish and having this knowledge I keep it in mind when shopping with them",

The only issue I have had lately is item I order being cancelled because distributors could not fill the orders. If that’s a ongoing issue I would find a better distributor. Some of the items they have cancelled from my order I go on the app and they are offered again at a higher price. I do get wish cash for the returned items which is nice because I can use it for my next order. Hopefully they will get to be like it was when I started buying and being more reliable with their orders. Delivery does seem to take forever but buying direct like this saves so much money.  That I don’t mind waiting. Some items were delivered later than they were supposed to but I did get them. I had a few items that were like a month late. People need to realize when shipping from one country to another that you don’t just send over one package at a time. You fill up a shipping container then send that. If you did ship individually prices for shipping would be way higher. Love you all at wish will continue to shop here as my returns we promptly handled and it’s only a mild inconvenience to ha e to reorder stuff.

I got a great deal on an item and received, not that item, but a letter and “free gift.” The gift was some pillow case with puppy pictures on it- useless to me. The letter explained that due to a quality problem at the factory, my item would be delayed 10 days. Wish, however, marked the item as received on the app once my letter was delivered so I contacted them with the photos they requested of my package and letter. At this point, I had been waiting for this item for well over a month and was hopeful that I would receive it- I told Wish this. However, they immediately issued a refund, which they falsely claim I requested, and have made no sense in my repeated email inquiries with them. They advised me to buy from another seller even though that took my price from $20 to $40 through another “store.” I’ve done that and am still waiting for the item, but in my opinion, wish cancelled my sale and made me pay double without any explanation. Was the first store a scammer? Is the second store really the same scammer as the first? Have they heard of this letter/gift scam? I have bought many things from them, but since they won't tell me what is going on with this, I don't trust them anymore. I told them to help me understand this since I planned to write a review, but they have offered no assistance.",

A few months ago, I ordered a bundle of items, and one after another, they each came broken. Broken. How lucky am I that several orders arrived broken, all in a row? So of course I try to contact support, and they immediately give me a refund ((A few I didn’t ask for a refund, I was just trying to let the store know their item was broke and they gave me a refund)). \nThe reason I gave this app one star is because since I “requested too many refunds” (again, a few I didn’t request refunds) I am now blocked from contacting support. Four or five contacts about broken items made me “blocked” from contacting support about anything.\nThe only way I “may be determined to be back in good standing” is to buy more. I am not about to go on a shopping spree on this sketchy website after my experience, just to be in “good standing”. Right now they’re not in good standing with me. I can not ask questions about orders that have not arrived, or get refunds on orders that never arrived. There are still things that I ordered months ago that have not came in and have no tracking info, but wish will not let me contact the sellers because I am blocked.\n I am very frustrated with this and do not plan on using it ever again.

This was half a year ago before I wrote this. As for customer service/support, where is it? It doesn’t exist. It’s a retail site/app that has no and I mean no custom service. Sure you can write an email to the ‘customer service’ but you most likely won’t get help on anything. \nI’m not the only person who’s experience stuff being sent back but two days before I wrote this my cousin ordered something from Wish and his item was sent back. It was on its way then was ‘canceled and being prepared to be sent back’ but then it said “oh nevermind we’ll just try harder to find your house.” It sounds like whoever sends out stuff are lazy and can’t handle their job. Which is probably true with Wish, people who work for wish are probably the underpaid people. Wish is basically a cheap website for people who don’t want to spend so much money on one thing. \nIn conclusion, just don’t even think about buying from them after reading this, I mean you obviously can I’m not anyone important. But I just want you to be happy with the stuff you get. 🤷🏻‍♀️",

They’re expecting no buyers to be anorexic “little people,” but even if one customer is anorexic and 3.5ft, they’re banking on them avoiding the least purchased color. This allows EVERY seller to make a clickbait price that misleads buyers until they click buy. It’s annoying because I can’t tell who actually DOES have the lowest price and I end up not buying at all. Or searching that item on eBay. This is rampant and ruining Wish, but the app overall is unique w/ potential. If they wanna make it last longer than internet fads like MySpace tho, fix that scam-like exploit.

If you paid for that abomination, I would demand your money back... and an apology.\nThe user interface change is so different from the previous app that it makes for a very confusing and frustrating experience.  I spent more time figuring out the cluttered navigation than I did shopping - and I apologize, but I do not believe you could have found a more hideous chimera of accent colors if you applied two AI’s and a team of failed design school dropouts to the task.  That sickly, washed-out mint green, tried to be aqua, and God I wish I were blue, is absolutely repugnant and nauseating to behold.  Marketing FAIL!  Please, for the sake of those of us with good color vision make it go away.  I will have to use the mobile website until it is purged.   If you just put it back the way it was, I’ll give it 5 stars out of mercy and never complain again.",

Gave up and went somewhere else. The filters and sort choices aren’t followed. I’m searching for a desk with a specific width, I chose that and alll that I get is everything but that width.  Why bother having a filter if it’s not usable? Or I put a price cap and filter by price and the results are in a random order and beyond the filters I’ve set. Understand if it’s one or two but 70% of results don’t fit the search terms and filters. Need to be able to filter for free shipping even if not prime. The search - need to have a way to go back to the search list, now i spent lots of time going down a search list then by mistake hit another “tab”at the bottom and my entire search list is gone. I lose where I was in my search, and need to start all over again.

I’m sorry but i have a I-Pad, not a I-PHONE I do not want them stupid buttons on the bottom like an I-phone app. Also along the bottom of the window there is a black spot that appear when you first open the app and it also appear to be a notification window but blank. I have tried to tap on it, move it, open it, expand it, but nothing works, it just sits there covering half the screen. Also the right side of page is covered up or running off the edge. You can’t reduce size to make page fit, nor move it over to read it. I have deleted app and reinstalled to try and correct problems, and it may work fine or it may not. When it does load right, the next time I open it’s back to the “I-Phone” format.",

It’s hard to look at and I feel like I have to pull my iPad several feet away to see it. It’s just too large for a larger screen, especially in landscape mode. Under Subscriptions, there used to be small tabs across the top for Deliveries, Subscriptions, and Settings. Now with this update there is a large banner across the top that takes up 1/3 of the screen, making it more difficult to scroll and see what I want to see. Again appears to be designed solely for the iPhone. This is an old gripe but I’d thought I’d mention it since I’m in here: on the product pages there used to be a button to send someone a link to the product. This disappeared a while ago and it would be nice to have that back. Now if I want to show something to someone I need to take a screenshot and text it to them rather than a link. Pretty annoying. I understand many or most of your customers use a phone to view your site, but it would be nice if iPad users could have better functionality and not have the screen look so awkward now.

In other words it looks exactly the same as the portrait mode version (on iPhone), but with abhorrent white space. I have no idea what prompted them to make this change or what its purpose is. Possibly they just wanted to make the image of the product bigger, but they already had the ability to zoom and even pull up a full screen version. Really I think they just got too lazy to maintain a separate iPad version, and I hate that more and more companies are doing this with their iPad version apps.",

And while frustrating it is always made worse by not giving people a way to opt out. The only useful usage I have seen is summarizing reviews. The most annoying usage I have found so far is not being able to read through previous questions about a product. I now HAVE to ask Rufus the idiot dog my question which takes twice as long since now I have to figure out how I want to word it. I realize that Rufus the idiot dog won’t be euthanized since AI is such a big “thing” and every company must add it in order to not be “left behind”. But in the case of the questions would it be so awful to have Rufus available for people to ask their questions to AND let people look through questions. Why does it have to be one or the other? Why alienate your customers in favor of a robot? For reference I don’t hate advancements in tech and am in my 20s. I just want things to be easy and this isn’t that.",

Funny because I had better delivery before I got prime, that says a lot about how they treat their customers that pay them monthly. Dont get me started on the “deals” &  “discounts”. They list it on “sale” for the regular price or maybe A LITTLE cheaper. It’s not worth it. Most of the “coupons” you have to subscribe to something to even get. I feel robbed because I only got prime for the deals thinking they’d be worth it. I’m lucky if I can get $20 off a $400 item. That’s crazy. So essentially I’m losing money every month paying for this because Im not purchasing anything because the deals are not worth it.  It seems like none of the cheaper essentials go on sale! BOO !!! It’s always the crazy expensive things that go on sale that I don’t need like a self cleaning litter box that gets discounted to $450 👎Yeah you get prime video,  but they have a horrible selection and I have to watch ads… on a streaming service I pay for and also don’t use. I want the 2 day shipping and actual good deals that they claim that they have! I pay for the deals. WHERE ARE THE DEALS!?",

Settling for both large sizes for the jackets I still went with the purchase. It was marked as delivered on Tuesday but only for three of the items which were too large jackets at one extra large sweater. The other large sweater was showing that it was being processed in the warehouse. But I still haven t received anything. Then Thursday morning I noticed that it was marked that all items were delivered. I called customer service about all of this and was told an investigation was going to be open and looked into.

I immediately tried to reconcile this through customer service but the agent said that I had missed my minute window of grace period to do this. It had in fact been less than 30 minutes and I feel that the agent deliberately responded late so that he could prolong our chat thus ensuring that I miss that window. It was absolutely ridiculous and I had proof via email confirmation that I still had time to get this fixed but the agent kept insisting that the button was no longer available to him. His suggestion was to return it upon arrival. Not sure how thats supposed to work when it s getting sent to my old address. So frustrating and it was an easy fix for a multi-billion dollar company who surely has the resources to do something as simple as alter the shipping address 20 minutes after the purchase was made.

Like the \"contests\" where they tell you a specific style, like winter and I spend all this time creating a dope winter look and then get back on to find someone in a swimsuit won like why even call a winter challenge? I kid you not, when they have the \"voting\", Ive come to the point where I pick the most backwards, \"polka dot & stripes\", ugly outfit because if you pick the one that is actually matching or stylish, its wrong!! ! I have ZERO other complaints other than it seems the \"contests\" are rigged with no real way of winning because I can throw on a fur coat for a pool party and win . just unfortunate they cant make the game actually real where you compete based on something being cute or within the description . instead its just really computers winning or people who put polka dot shoes with a plaid skirt and a striped shirt with a camo jacket . anyway, recommend the game 100% but dont expect to win the challenges no matter how fashionable you are or how much my follow the \"instructions\" for the challenge.

But the part at the beginning we re u see them in the boxes in a order, WHATS THE POINT! It s impossible to memorize and u have to rely on pure luck to win. For the beginning part were u see them in the boxes, plz make a change and keep them in there spots when they get mixed up so when u go to pick the boxes, you know we re they are. Again, I love this game for the bottom of my ! But plz listen or at least think about my request bc I m sure other people feel the same way to."

I did buy the 99 cent ad-free version because the regular ads were so frequent it made the game almost impossible to play. I do two biggest issues with the game still though. One, the constant pop-up in-app purchase ads are obnoxious to say the least. If I do any type of event, giving the customer their outfit, coloring game, etc. the screen then loads up a bunch of suggestions for in-app purchases that seem really excessive. Like 3 plus in-app purchase suggestions I have to click out of before doing anything else. It s super annoying considering I paid for no ads, but the in-app purchases are just as annoying as regular ads. My other issue is that the ticket game seems to be wholeheartedly rigged now. I remember when I first had the app that I would occasionally, maybe once every 20 ticket games I played, that I got all 3 keys and unlocked the jackpot. I don t think I ve gotten all 3 keys in months and I play this game frequently. Statistically you d think maybe I would get the 3 keys every so often, but it doesn t happen at all anymore. I really do love the game, but sometimes those factors make me not want to play. I totally understand it s important for the developers to get money in order to run the game and to get paid, but it seems like this game has just become a cash-grab."

Annoying, purely on principle I choose that one , which I like, and not the correct one, regardless of the money. And by the way, the options approved by the developers look very strange and ugly, and you will never choose them, because they are ugly, in which case you will not get money. Advertising was also closed and because of this, many functions are unavailable, but advertising is still offered to watch. And why in competitions for example Winter's Tale or Pool Party a person in a fur coat, camouflage pants and massive boots can win at a pool party, but in Winter fairy tale\" in a style top, in a polka dot skirt, and someone's grandmother's shoes, and crazy professorial glasses, when I create a suitable and very beautiful image?!

First is that whenever I open the app after a few hours without using it it gives me all these different pop ups telling me to buy stuff, witch of course is ok but I can be a little annoying sometimes. Next is that I feel that every time I style an outfit it s always Amazing or something along the lines of This pivot is great but sometimes I don t even use the certain color they wanted or something like that, but they never say anything about it. Witch I understand that they want everyone to feel good about their creation but maybe sometimes the customer couldn t get what they want and get mad or not want it or something like that. But I really love this app and it can be VERY addictive. Because of all the things you can click on for different prizes, that s what makes a game entertaining and enjoyable. But enough talking about me, I just want to thank the developers for making this game and putting the time and effort to make the updates great and also respond to the reviews, I ve been reading the reviews and they respond to most of them!

But I would recommend a few changes. For example, I fell in love with some of the earring sets and eye make up sets that have been released, but I couldn t get any of them because they cost real money, and I don t think that s really fair. After all, not everyone can afford to spend real money, and some of us have parents who won t let us. I think that when they first come out you should at least be given a chance to earn them by completing challenges or something, and then after several days if you don t get them all, then charge real money. I would also make the catalogs and vouchers for clothes cost less gems, and you should be able to use my money earned in the game to buy some of them too. It would also be cool to see things like hats, blush, accessories for hair, and Ads pop up often in the game (which I don t mind), but 90% of the time I can t put lipstick on a client because when I try to play the ad there isn t one available.

The ads are way too much- but developers gotta make money so I get it. There is one after everything you do. I was willing to pay the amount to get rid of them permanently. It was worth it to me but may not be for you. Also the ads that I do watch in order to get additional money or gems - are so inappropriate it s jaw dropping. If my child was playing this and saw these ads I d be furious. I m not sure if the developers can do anything about that though or maybe they can. Aside from those things this game is truly so much fun. At this point I m just dying for more clothing options since I ve acquired most of them now. If you re willing to spend $20-$50 bucks on something to clear my mind and you love fashion - I recommend for sure! After reading other peoples reviews, I feel super lucky mine hasn t glitched or anything. I ve had nothing but a great experience with this. The developers have to make money which is why there are so many ads so the people complaining about that is odd to me. Nothing is free. I ll continue to play this game even if it costs me some money as it s my one thing I treat myself to game wise."

I honestly think this game is too basic. You people have the idea going that she has clients and all that other stuff, But I personally think that you have to add more and more details to draw more people into the game. And another problem is that the game has to much advertisements for stuff that costs money. I think that it should be more about earning stuff then what you have in real life and what you don t have. And I get that the developers need money. But people are just looking for entertainment not another reminder of money! Cause people don t need another Reason to think about that! Oh and also. More on the money . I have around ten thousand dollars in the game. But a client needs a new sporty dress catalog. But it costs 20,0 dollars and then you stop getting clients, and then you stop getting money to buy the catalog. So after me naming all of this you developers need to take this into consideration if you want to keep people playing my game.

The winners are always some randomized outfit like a bright pink jacket with dull tan sweatpants and like an ugly orange shirt or smt like that and the other outfit MATCHES WITH COLOR but yet the ugly outfit wins! It should be called which outfit does not match? Or smt Bc the outfits are the most randomized you ve ever seen. They don t match by color OR style at all. They will be total opposites of the color wheel like blue, red, and yellow and smt will be fur, smt will be polka dots, and another will be bright neon. I m not even kidding so you have no chance in guessing correctly. There are also too many ads may I add. Every 10 seconds is an ad. If u click on anything, an ad pops up. Wanna change ur avatar? An ad pops up. Wanna style someone? An ad pops up. And everything costs real life money as well! Not everyone has a money farm growing off trees! I m just rlly upset that y all make everything so overpriced as well! Like a new hairstyle for 120 gems? And u have to buy the gems as well with real money. I ve been playing for 2 years now and I only have 50 gems. Mostly Bc I only get like 3 or 5 gems time to time from challenges. Many things are overpriced and votings are rigged.

I m currently at level 25 and my options get wider as you play more. I love playing this game. My only thing that bugs me is unwanted purchases. I don t mean with real currency or anything, I mean in the game. When you open the game you have to click through all the news, daily sales, monthly challenges, etc. Sometimes, when I m clicking through, I accidentally purchase something I don t really need/want. THIS DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELY CRAZY! It happened to me again today, I was at maybe 150 diamonds, and I accidentally clicked purchase and bought a bag. My currency on the diamonds went to 21. My suggestion for the game is for when you purchase something over cash or 5 diamonds, it has a pop up saying, Are you sure you d like to purchase? Or something similar. All in all, it is a super fun game, and I enjoy playing it, I just don t like the unauthorized purchases."

It s very easy to win, but almost always the computer will win at least 1 out of every 5 rounds. No matter how good you do. 2) needs more concepts,outfits,hair styles, here s a few ideas: cowgirl, goth girl, princess, spooky, Christmas, could even do countries, or cities. 3) more customization for my character, like maybe instead of having presets maybe you could have a customizable model, and also customization for the runway, like maybe we can spend the gems we earn on different looking runways. 4) more creative chapters, like better backgrounds n stuff. Overall it s a pretty addicting game and such, I really like it, and think it could do really good. It s something to play when you re just wanting to kill time, still gets very repetitive tho. Would like to see more added to it OH ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING! To add, needs background music. Maybe potentially matching the chapter my at?

But if both of you get all hearts, the computer always wins by like 2 or 3 points! Even if you think you did it better than them. Like I always lose when we both get all hearts. Also, it can be very frustrating when you have no competition. Like they make it so easy to win in some rounds. Like once in Bohemian, when it was the concept, the other person didn't even dress Bohemian! But I kind of get that, like they might not have known what it was. But things like Beach, come on. Everyone knows what the beach is. And in Masculine, the competitor wore a rainbow zebra top. That s not masculine at all. Over all, it s a really great game."

I also wish there were more ways to customize my character besides just picking skin color. Why not eyes or nail color? Or lip color? I also noticed that the game has a pattern of scoring. If you get everything right in the categories this is what the scoring would be.. if the opponent got a 19, you would get . If the opponent got a 20, you would get 28. If the opponent got a 21 you would get a 29, and if a 22 you would receive a 30. The game has very predictable scoring and rounds. I also see a lot of models with VERY tacky clothing and yet they still win. Who wears gym shoes to the beach?! Like c mon .

This can get pretty annoying even though the goal is to win and to have the better outfit. Second, this game isn t a brilliant choice for younger kids, for example, some of the words they use can be inappropriate and also it teaches children to be rude to the loser. Just as you push you opponent off and act like it s amazing and incredible that you won. This should be changed and teach others to be good sports, they could do this by changing the rudeness into a high-five. And last, the adds can get pretty annoying. In the middle of a game, an add will pop up and can interrupt my game. This can be changed by showing adds at the end of a round or before a round. Otherwise this is an amazing game and I recommend it. Wishing you all the best, Myra"

The clothes are cute and constantly being updated, I love the art style, the makeup and hair are cute, and you can fully customize any outfit as you or something straight out of a fantasy movie, the creativity is seriously endless. Whatever you want to make, you can. And the VERY best part is that you don t have to spend real money. I ve cashed in a few times, but my girlfriend never has and is at an even higher level than me. You can get gems through voting, daily gifts, and watching short ads, and it works. I seriously appreciate it. I usually eventually grow tired of fashion games, but I always come back to SUITSME. It s easy to use, but has the right amount of competition to make it feel actually exciting to get results. If you re looking for the perfect fashion game to show actual creativity, not spend real money on, and do real voting with, this is for you. I love SUITSME."

However, why not support a game that gives you hours and hours of fun versus a night out? Dinner and a movie costs far more and is gone when the evening is over. The improvements needed? I agree wholeheartedly with everyone else about the voting. it really needs improvement. This problem is why I did not give the game five stars. It is very disheartening when you put a lot of effort into following the instructions. googling the era or person. and someone else wins who paid no attention whatsoever to the parameters given. for example, tossing on a gown for an event that specifies a roller blading theme. I mean, come on. One thing that would really help is if we had the option to skip. all too often, I am forced to vote for the lesser of two evils and a truly horrible option gets points it does not deserve. I know for a fact some mothers let their toddlers vote and even style. Another thing that is needed is a much better search tool. there are literally hundreds of options to scroll through and the ability to search using subcategories and even typing in words like tulle or lace or sheer, etc. would be very helpful. Note to SuitsMe. .. my Support button sends me to a computer based email which I do not use, so it does not work for me. I use internet email, and I think most people do."

Maybe it s a bunch of young kids playing, but a lot of the top 5 looks do not even match the challenge, or there are MUCH better looks who are in the bottom of the 10. For instance, with the Elizabeth Bennett challenge, the 1st place winner, along with the additional 2nd and 3rd place winners all dressed extravagantly, with tiaras and lots of sparkle and jewels. Had they read the challenge description or even googled who she was, they would know she was poor. People are just voting on the prettiest looks, and not on whatever look fits the description, it makes absolutely no sense. I spend real money on this game, buying season passes, along with packs & gems and am so disappointed with this. That is the only up-side to Covet. The voting is at least fair and it seems as though older people are playing it, and playing THAT game correctly. if you don t know who a person is, simply GOOGLE them so you can at least see a pic of the person. It s absolutely ridiculous and I m about to stop playing because it s just really unfair. If you re not going to take the time to read the challenge description or are completely unaware of the person you re supposed to be dressing as, why even bother entering the challenge or voting?!"

I tried to that a couple times and the ad just ends and takes me back to the store where I have to wait five minutes for a video to be available, but my gem amount is the same as when it started. Overall I do enjoy the game quite a bit! I feel like it s even helping me better understand my own wardrobe and creative ways to reuse pieces. Like others I agree that the voting system can be a drag when you end up with top place finishers who aren t on the theme (how did second place in my round of rainbow daze go to a b&w monochrome outfit ) but I have no suggestions for what would address that, just seems like a thing that s going to happen sometimes. Maybe if people can t vote in rounds they have an entry in to encourage them to vote more fairly? Idk. It s a drag when it happens but most of the time I think the results tend to make sense. I also love that it s just a straight forward fashion game. No puzzles or stories to sit through, those kinds of games are everywhere and it s refreshing to have one that s simply login, dress up, move on."

You can select a color to filter and see an item clearly labeled a different color, so if you filtered for that color you d never see it. Also, pajamas they re under every style you can filter. There s no easy way to find them. That s also true for the robes. They re under capes in different styles. I don t understand why there isn t a sleepwear category like for the under layers. Like I said, I haven t spent a dime. Lately, I ve played so many rounds to earn all rewards of that week s season. My streak is currently 287, but it s starting to feel like a job instead of fun. This is especially true when I get a low score and the winner has a very plain/basic look (sometimes not matching in the slightest). This doesn t happen very often, but after spending hard earned cash and gems, it s frustrating, and I ve seen others that totally should have won. For example, one design was #2 and an almost identical design was #9. The only difference? The shoes. The shoes on the #2 design was sneakers and the #9 was heels the outfit? Dresses. I d very upset if that was me. The game is just too much of a hassle, and the time required to earn the rewards makes this game less fun than it s worth. It s time for me to move on to something else."

I also struggle with the fact that the make up options are predesigned, full-face looks instead of individual components that you can combine to better suit my style. Even still, there are a wide variety of options and chances are, you can find a makeup look that you like. I love seeing the new additions every time you level up and or a new season begins. It s like a never ending wardrobe, what s not to love? The organization methods for sorting each category (tops, bottoms, jumpsuits, etc.)have been updated and continue to be updated, so though it s still not a perfect system, it s getting better. You can tell that the makers of the game tried to be very inclusive with a variety of skin tones to choose from including some more untraditional ones.

Plus, the graphics are far superior and there are significantly more challenges per day that are varied in requirements and theme. That being said, there are some issues I have with it. First being that I m a season pass player, but despite my activity, I am never able to finish it and gain all the rewards. I think the season time limit needs to be extended a few more days or so. A final problem I have with it, is the rating system. I notice that sometimes it depends on how much time is left on the challenge that determines the score. So, I typically don t play challenges that only have a few more hours left since that s less time my outfit can be rated on. I also notice that my looks are now struggling to get the ratings they deserve (based on the time, gems/coins spent, and being on theme). I wouldn t be as frustrated if I felt that the looks ranking higher deserved the score. Don t get me wrong, there are plenty of my submissions that I don t think are the best, but it s discouraging when the ranking and rewards gained don t match up with how much time and currency I ve spent on them."

The only thing is the prettiest/trendiest items are going to be pricier and make you spend all those gems in an instant. Things range cheap from 120 coins all the way up to diamonds for things like hair and jewelry. A lot of times you need to buy these items to get an outfit that looks decent and fashionable. It is very difficult to score perfectly to get high scores for prizes and even then the most gems you can win is like for a look that costs you gems to begin with. You get an entry reward of anywhere from only 30 to maybe 300 coins? That barely covers stockings and a handbag. And the daily videos, voting, and gifts are a joke. You get 20 diamonds as a daily gift and to even watch a video to get more you only get 7-8 more gems. And for voting you have to vote on like 5 outfits and you only get like 5 coins or 12 gems at the most and then it ends. This game wants my money. I even paid the starter pack. I guess if you want horrible scores and re use clothes to do the daily deal challenge or whatever it is called maybe you can earn a little more, but this is ridiculous. And I ll probably get a message from the developers that it is a free game and tips on gems when really it doesnt help."

So unless my using REAL money and buying stuff in game it gets boring after level 5 because you can hardly afford anything after playing a few times. Yea they give you rewards for entering but not enough for what my spending. For example I m guessing it s the daily freestyle that gives the most reward back. Only $250. But my spending way more than that on the whole outfit. Other selection on the games only give you like $70 lol like what is that ? 3. So you bought all those clothes right each outfit maybe around $700-$ in game. Probably more if my a tad bit fancier sometimes lol. But get this, the gag is you can only wear them ONCE. You spent all that money and can t rewear the outfit UNLESS YOU PAY AGAIN So as I stated in the beginning it s fun but only up until level 5."

I also have an issue with the payout system of the game, I can only make one or two outfits to submit a day. And the price of buying gems is way too expensive. I feel like if you lower the price of gems to somewhere around $3 for say 500 gems you would get a lot more people willing to put money into the game. That coupled with more options and you d have me invest more time and money into this game. I still go and design outfit for every challenge but it s such a bummer that I have to choose carefully which challenges I enter. This could be a great game it just needs a little tweaking!

The amount of ads was frustrating enough for a while, but now I will get pages of imagery that isn t actually showing real places or even real people. If I m using Pinterest to get ideas for a realistically achievable patio space, or a new hair style or hair color, I don t want to see computer-generated images of women who all have the same face or a landscaping job that doesn t actually exist. Pinterest has a lot of value as a tool to help communicate goals and visual wants to professionals working with clients. How is it fair to professional designers if their clients keep bringing them images of things that never existed in reality in the first place? How is it fair to those same artists and designers if the work that is getting pinned and shared is not theirs, but is instead generated by a machine ? It s frustrating at a basic level and very eerie and disturbing at another.

In the older versions, it was more geared to crafting/diy/budget ideas. Now, I search for something simple like knitting ideas, and all I get back are shopping suggestions and priced items for sale. And there s even a shopping section! I understand the need to evolve and bring in new demographics, but I feel that a lot of Pinterest s original draw and identity has disappeared. Now, it behaves more like an Instagram or Facebook feed, filled with advertisements and shopping. It s very disappointing to me that Pinterest has become so much like all the other dime-a-dozen social media apps and sites, since I initially fell in love with it years before because it avoided that world I hated. It felt quiet, calm, secluded, like a library or a yarn store, and I could do my own thing with topics I loved across the board.

I mainly use it to curate aesthetics and find inspiration for my life. It s very soothing and artistic to me, and the only social media I ll use. However, I feel as though Pinterest has recently gone down hill. There s an overwhelming amount of ads. To the point of every other pin is an ad. Most of them are irrelevant to me and my feed is no longer aesthetically pleasing, just full of junk. And I m not opposed to tasteful ads- I ve even bought multiple products advertised to me on Pinterest that had beautiful ads that matched my interest and weren t overwhelming. But there s just too many now and too many pointless ones. It makes Pinterest significantly less enjoyable. I also don t understand why Pinterest no longer shows you who pinned the pins in my feed, and when you click in you can t click on the original user who pinned. It s totally confusing and counterintuitive- I keep trying to click the icons of people to view their profile but I can t. The best way for me to do it is to scroll through the hundreds of people I follow to find them. It s a huge pain. I m satisfied with most of the other features of this app and glad to be a part of the community!"

Almost everyday for the last year Iv had Pinterest send an email stating they have deactivated one of my pins for violent or inappropriate behavior. I always submit an appeal and you know why? Most of what I save is art and or photography. I don t save any nudes or violent acts, so I kept wondering why my pins were getting deactivated so I started trying to use the one time link which btw doesn t show you pin if my on an app"

I use all the platforms so I know that if you change from the home feed to my profile or to the search tab back to the home feed, the home feed automatically refreshes. when I even open the app sometimes I see a pin right away that I d pin but for some reason it refreshes!! This is so irritating. Like Twitter. You can t even scroll through the feed sometimes without it randomly updating. Also the ads Pinterest.. come on. They re every third pin! I get you have to pay the bills but more often than not my ads are irrelevant to my search. Ads are not helping you. Pinterest was for curation, for creation. Not to be another soul sucking platform for over consumption. And, why is it that when I search one thing my home feed will suddenly be filled with that one search? I didn t follow the topic, I didn t follow a new board, I don t care to see it on the home feed I have sort of curated myself. This has been a lot of complaints and my rating is low so that you get how irritated I am.. I love you Pinterest, rarely change."

It s extremely wild that this is happening and Pinterest are just ignoring people who are trying to get their attention to get their account back. I know it might seem like me and other people are overreacting but Pinterest is truly such a fun app, and having that taken away for no reason is so frustrating. This shouldn t be happening and it should never happen. I know it could be a mistake by bot reviewers but bot reviewers should not be able to deactivate or suspend accounts. Bot reviewers should only be able to report their triggers to a human reviewer and let that human reviewer decide what s actually happening. Overall this app is amazing but this is the only thing that vexes me, truly. (Sorry if there were any grammatical errors I m kinda stressed out from this.)"

And I mean HUNDREDS of people talking about how completely normal, safe, appropriate pins they ve saved have been removed because, guess what, ai can t correctly or accurately tell the difference between normal/sfw and explicit/harmful content. Not that the CEO cares though since he s been deleting people s comments with complaints on Twitter. If things don t change for the better, chances are Pinterest will lose a lot of users and therefore lose revenue from getting too greedy, which I d hate to see because I used to love the platform.

Long story short it s a feature that shouldn t have been removed. Aside from that, the updates to the comment sections as a whole haven t been my favorite. The new react feature seems a bit pointless; in the past you could like a comment and it was simple. There was a number of people that liked it and a heart lit up when you liked it. The new feature not only shows other people s reaction in color- it only changes to loved or helpful in a dull color, which makes it really hard for people with poor eyesight, dyslexia, etc to discern which comments they have reacted to (since they are already in color) The helpful option as opposed to the loved option makes sense, but it seems more trouble that it s worth.

The few issues I have encountered have been met with overall good customer service. I was pleased when they began to offer various shipping fees (4.99, 5.95, & 7.11), as I agree with what many others have said, that since the market for USED and AFFORDABLE clothing is the main focus of this app, a $7 shipping fee can often be the price or near the price of the item you are buying. A suggestion would be to fix the categories people filter, shop, and create listings by. As an example, the women s dresses category has numerous subcategories that are varying descriptors of a dress. Mini, maxi, one shoulder, long sleeve, strapless, et cetera. But what if you have a one shoulder maxi dress? Or a long sleeve mini dress? Which category do you select? I believe changing these categories to be more cohesive would make it much easier and less confusing for people to find what they are looking for. For example, instead of all these random subcategories, perhaps all the subcategories could pertain to the same aspect of a dress. Like the subcategories are mini, midi, maxi. Or sleeveless, short sleeve, long sleeve. I believe that could greatly improve how quickly and easily shoppers can find what they have in mind using the filter tools."

At this point, I rarely sell on Posh anymore, as Mercari is just a better experience all around. I still maintain that Posh needs to figure out a lower shipping cost for lower-weight items such as most jewelry, perhaps with value tiers (eg I d ship something precious at a higher cost than costume). I also really like the Promote feature on Mercari, where you can promote my listings by dropping their prices. Previous Review: Just read the reviews. I m not alone. There s almost no real customer service. I definitely spend way more than I make on Posh, but a recent selling experience combined with the disgustingly high shipping costs has me seriously reconsidering using this app in the future. Shipping costs should be tiered based on item. A pair of stud earrings should absolutely never cost $7.11. It s stopped me from many purchases. Also their cut is way too high on lower-priced items. But ultimately it s the lack of seller protection or support that are finally driving me away. Buyers can cancel sales hours later for no real reason, and that s just allowed with Posh. Nope!"

Never in a million years did I think I d love selling clothes or even meet some of the greatest people, on a clothing application. It s indescribable. It s so much fun. It really is. You have to try it to believe it. It s not complicated. It s not overwhelming. You sell something and poshmark emails you the shipping label. You print the label slap it on the box and drop it at the post office. That s it. How much easier can it get? And I ve met more people on poshmark than instagram. It s a positive environment. I remember getting my first package from my first purchase and inside the box there was a Something that simple made the whole experience feel like I was getting something from a friend. Not a stranger. I m not the clothing app kind of person. I never would have thought I d enjoy something like this over my social media apps. But I do. I love it! Just try it. You ll see what I mean."

I have so many clothes, never have I gotten rid of anything in the past 30 years, some of it is 30 years old with the tags on it still! It s too valuable to me to just donate to the Goodwill and when you do something like have a garage sale or go to a consignment shop, you usually only get a few bucks at the most for something. So with nowhere to go with it, I ve hung onto it for years. One night while trying to figure out what to do with an old jacket that was valuable, I had the idea to put it on Poshmark. I had recently found out Poshmark was free to list items and this is why I went with Poshmark. I posted the item and in the morning it had sold for $100!! So then I did it again with two more items, and the next morning, those were sold also! So I ve been doing it for two months now and I ve made over $, I have hundreds of items on there and this is the perfect platform for my things! I wish I knew about this sooner but I m just happy to have found it when I did! I ve also rotated out my current wardrobe and I ve gotten an entire new closet full of clothes! Where has Poshmark been all my life?!?!"

              "text": "I love poshmark and I ve been an avid buyer and seller or posher since . However there needs to be updates made to the app. For example, if you click on a listing it will tell you the date and month that it was posted/ updated but it won t tell you the year. Meaning the post could have last been updated on say June 24th but it will only say June 24th . Also, there should be a rule or something that requires poshers to update their listings every two weeks or so. Half the time I ve bought a product and I ll have to wait a week for the order to automatically cancel b/c either a.) they didn t update it /haven t been active for weeks, months, years, or they just no longer have the item and never tell you. My second complaint, is that I feel that poshmark cares more about the buyers than the sellers and that s not fair. I feel like poshmark sends many reminder emails about making sure to ship out a product, but they don t do the same to the buyers when it s time for them to rate the purchase in order to complete it so the seller can get paid. Poshmark doesn t release the funds until either the buyer rates and confirms the delivery or if they don t do that within three days , poshmark automatically does it for you but why should I have to wait three days? It s inconvenient and inconsiderate."

Honestly finding Posh again opening the App I started crying such growth in the business so many people all the New information.

May this App continue to inspire and give back to all of the wonderful ladies who strive so hard to be the best part of Great Women at every corner. Mom s, CEO s, Wife s,Business owners we ladies own this spectrum. Remember every piece that is put out for us was once a special item that was needed or admired or a must have for an occasion. A lot of times these very items carry great memories and even shoppers remorse.

The problem is that the website now loads only eight items at a time. When you scroll down you get a message that says loading more and after a few seconds another eight items will load. The slowness is frustrating enough, but the biggest problem is that after so many scrolls and loading more messages the screen will go white and then throw you back at the top of my closet. You now have to start all over again. It s very frustrating and has made browsing and sharing nearly impossible. I am now starting to list on other platforms because without being able to share my closet, my sales have dropped significantly. I wrote support multiple times. I normally received prewritten responses. I finally received a response from a developer and they temporarily changed things back, but after about a week it went back to the new system of loading only eight items a time. I loved Poshmark, but this system update has made it almost unusable from a sellers standpoint and has forced me to start listing on other sites. Very disappointed."

              "text": "I initially thought Posh was a fun way to sell on line but the high fees and shipping rates are a problem. I have literally received 5 cents from selling items for $3. Once the item is below $10 then the minimum Posh fee of $2.95 becomes greater than 20%. Additionally, it s hardly worth paying $6.49 in shipping fees for inexpensive lightweight items. I think this structure needs to be revised. As a seller, I basically give away stuff; regardless of how low I price merchandise, the offers come in ridiculously (insultingly) lower where I often prefer not to sell. As a buyer, the items I like are marked up above what I see in retail (or they are not bargain shoppers and grossly over paid from the start). The constant promotions just encourage us to continue marking stuff down with no benefits. I don t think the application is easy to use as I would like to be able to look at the sellers stats before a purchase to assure quality. I did appreciate the free authentication of items above $500. Additionally, sellers must stay alert to constant scammers. I don t think I will continue to do this much longer. There should be more avenues to provide feedback, like themes for Posh parties like: White Party Attire (all white items), Game Day (jerseys and sports paraphernalia), Plus size parties, High Cotton (only 100% cotton), etc. I think requiring the fabrication as listed on labels is important."

You post clothes you no longer need or want at a reasonable price and someone will buy them. Wonderful. Now I have room in my closet and a little money for shopping. The app was bare bones. You scroll through and what you see is what you get. Then people started using this as a job just to make money. They d buy clothes from thrift stores and mark them way up. People post items very visibly worn or damaged. There should be a quality standard. There should be better controls about price gouging. There should be better controls around mistagged items. There are items listed as a certain brand or style for views, but photos show the item is not as described. Poshmark then opened it up to children s and men s clothing. Then they changed the scrolling and would show the same items again and again. Then they started adding promoted items which means my search results are now riddled with nonsense that you have zero interest in. Every 2 rows there are promoted items. Let me search for what I want, show it to me once, and don t fill my results with anything else I am not specifically looking for. All of these issues make poshmark a huge waste of time. The developer doesn t care about user experience just keeping people scrolling. Next they ll start showing ads."

Why is it that at the end of each play you have a choice to double my score if you watch a video. Well don t you think that option should be working if you are giving players that option and also why are you giving the option to watch multiple videos and then if you take advantage of that option you are only allowed to watch some and not all of them. For example, if at the beginning of a play you may want to buy a certain outfit but you don t have enough coins for that outfit well you may have to watch 5 or maybe 6 videos on some but you can t watch them so because you don t have the coins and you can t watch the videos you only have the option of choosing what you don t want. You re not making this fun for us gamers by having all of these problems. I have turned 8 of my girlfriends on to this game and every last one of them are already talking about deleting it. I also agree with an earlier review. I can choose the exact same outfit as my opponent and my outfit bombs and hers will get a straight 10. Glitch or coincidence. You need to do some major updating and or maintenance. Well I didn t want to even say it but I will be deleting this game from my gaming list.

Majority of the items in the store cost more than what you can get for watching two videos which could give you each time you watch one. Meaning you would have to watch a series of ads before you can purchase an entire new outfit. Not only that, up until a certain point the reward after the stages are only a fraction of what you can actual buy in the store. You can basically put on whatever because as long as you pick items that need to be bought either with coins or with videos, and select the items with hot and perfect under them you get a good score. It didn t occur to me that I could watch videos solely to earn money so it took me a while to get to the style challenge portion which in whole was a huge waste of time and was the only reason why I didn t the app then and there. I was under the impression that it would be a challenge with you and other people who played the game, but no it s just the computer again. There isn t even any excitement in the judging. The time limit is a bit dumb but could potentially be a cool concept if it was rational. The tallying up or the judging part is a two second process which only advocates for my earlier claim and is just downright underwhelming. It s the same thing as the other challenge but with a time limit."

It is very hard to enjoy a game when u have to watch like up to 8 adds for every single piece of clothing or accessory or background. Even when I'm trying to play the next level, it gives me an add.

But only if someone hasn t chosen an add in a certain amount of time, say 72 hours, then you can have a pop up ad. But otherwise I say you should change the pop up ads. But besides all of that, the game is really fun I love the clothes and the makeup and everything. I also think you REALLY should add more hair color options. That would make the game even more fun.

I do not understand why developers want to use ads that are not reflective of the age of its targeted players. It is a waste to put healthcare ads from some insurance company in front of a 6 year or a 10 year old or even a teenager. Plus the ads are way too long and run across multiple screens which is confusing to younger players. Developers should pay attention to this when deciding to rate an app for young children or when choosing ad content for its 4+ players.

The higher level of course is going to get the vote. Higher levels always do because they have the cool makeup or hairstyle. Work on this Covert! 2) Top Look/Perfect Score is usually always the high levels and all the looks-look the same. What happened to fashion being an expression of one s personality. 3) Borrowing, again I strongly believe the Players who are in a Fashion House and have Friends should be allowed to borrow 1 item from each per outfit. Do a test run and see if we the players responded positively or negatively. 4) This is a pive of mine. Most of the time I have to piece together words to figure out the challenge. 5) About challenges, if you ask the players to dress a nurse, you should provide scrubs as an option. That is just one example. I could literally go on. 6) Hair accessories should be an award, players should not have to spend $8.99 of our money. If you want to charge than players should be allowed to purchase with game money or diamonds. 7) A big pive of mine is being required to purchase jewelry on a challenge and because of the scene the earrings don t even show. Other than the things I mentioned, the game is fun."

I appreciate the little changes in diversity that the developers have added. But I feel that there should be MORE changes make to the game than just the appearances. For example, When I enter 28 challenges and won the months styling spree prize, it was out of season. I don t think it s fair to make this that way. I also believe when a new season starts and you have barely any money to spend on creating a whole new closet, you should get a welcome gift for each season to help start you off betterIt s unfair to expect everyone to turn to their wallet for everything. I think you should get my tickets and diamonds at the beggining of the day instead of having to wait until evening to use them. You should be able to earn game cash more in challenges you have to buy things for, not just daily challenges. When I have voted on looks, I have noticed that they put very high level players against players almost 30 levels lower than them at times. I do not believe that this is fair to the players, I think it should at least be within the range of the player. If you read this, I think it s worth playing the game, but just as well, there are definetly flaws that make gameplay not as enjoyable. *Abby B.*"

It makes sense that players that have been playing the game For seven years to win the top looks. I m about a year and a half in now and grinding for my hair accessories in rallies and slowly learning how to get votes is what makes this game so addicting. Leveling up is rewarding because I m given a even better competitive edge if I know how to use it right. I would hate it if I wasn t able to compete against level 55 players even though I m only Level 13. (Level 17 since I first wrote this review) Also I appreciate that they have best look in every level so that lower levels can see if they re at the top within their level bracket. Note for developers: fashion houses are the best part of the game. But my lists of fashion houses are full of dead houses. I ve seen so many succesful houses collapse after they were selected to be a house option from the quiz. Placing 6 new players or more in a house all at once puts too much strain and rallies are no longer achievable. Personally I think no more than 3 should be added In one placement session. Also searching for an active house"

The challenges, while offering diamonds as a prize, are quite difficult to climb high enough if you do not initially spend a lot of money to buy the stuff. It s frustrating. Spending even just $10 for diamonds only gets a few challenges out of it as long as you don t buy the most expensive pieces. It s truthfully not the best way to treat the customers. Even the earn diamonds section where you can subscribe to stuff is a bit of a joke. You do have the option of borrowing from someone in my fashion house but either my fashion house is hard core you need to enter every challenge, or there isn t enough people to enter challenges or borrow from anyone. I don t agree with the way the scoring is and how people are judged. There can be a level 106 against a level 3. There can be people who create a look completely inline with what the challenge requests but someone else will do better scoring wise in nothing related to the challenge at all. I do take a break from the game every now and again and still the complaints are the same. They have done a slightly better job being inclusive for diversity but most of the diverse looks are still pretty stereotypical. Creating a look that s Asian instead of honoring the various cultures and countries that make up that continent."

It is incredibly frustrating for a couple of different reasons. 1) The voting system is terrible. Looks are voted on by other players, but sometimes a level 6 is pitted against a level 57 and there is literally no way someone just starting out could compete with the closet, hair, and makeup available to a level 57! I try to level the playing field by always voting for the one with the lowest-level hair. Someone with a gorgeous fancy hairstyle is probably a high level, whereas I can easily recognize the lower-level hairstyle. I know it s not fair to judge this way, but I feel it s the only way to give the newer players a chance! The next thing is actually my biggest frustration with the game. When you first start off playing, you advance levels pretty easily I want to say every $25,0 or $50,0 spent (of Covet money, of course! Not real money, lol). Then, once you reach a certain point, you only level up every $100,0. It makes the game a lot less fun for me. I m not trying to spend a ton of my own money, which I m sure many of the higher-level people do (I always imagine them as housewives who don t work but have an unlimited amount of money to spend on an app), so it takes forever to level up. any other complaints are minor, but if these two things were fixed, the game would be almost perfect."

The more items in my closet, the higher the value of my closet. The more items you have to chose from, the better my results. So how is it fair, to put a level 12 next to a level 46, and have voters choose the best look? Clearly the odds are in the favor on the person who has more items in their closest. Obviously the person who is a higher level is good at design, so it s not like that they got there by luck. If you are going to have voters choose, put a level 12 against a level 11 or 13, maybe a 14. I think they are aiming to get people to buy more diamonds to add things to their closest, because you pretty much have to buy more to get to the higher levels. Also, to get things like tiaras and veils (they have bridal challenges), you have to be at the higher levels AND pay $9 to unlock them. I decided to try one design with a tiara, and a similar design on another without a tiara. The one with a tiara got a 4.96 rating from voters. The one that didn t, barely got a 4 rating. Unblock a few more accessories or at minimum, give one vail, and a tiara like headpiece. Or, don t make people pay for every single hair accessory. Get to the levels unlock the basic ones, and the more elaborate ones you can charge for. Fix the uneven voting and I ll change my rating."

Now, I ve played the game long enough to know that yes, challenges have certain items that have to be worn. But there is still a HUGE variety of things to create. I keep coming back to the game because I love fashion, but I always stop playing because I don t think it s allowing people to be individual. Maybe our votes don t count unless you spend money. But when a game doesn t let you advance unless you spend money, it s not really fun. Otherwise I would pay ONCE and then have all the closet items unlocked. Or have a monthly subscription or something. But I get so tired of seeing the exact same copy cat for top looks. And majority of the looks are actually the newest and/or most costly pieces. The thing about fashion is that it s so diverse and different. That s why you don t see people walking around wearing the same pants with the same shirt, same hair style and color walking the same dog. I know you have the ability to switch it up.

I also wish there was a way to purchase hair accessories or props without spending real money. I understand the app needs to make money but it s a little frustrating because most of the top voted looks are decked out with hair accessories and props that I imagine most users don t have access to because they are not willing to continuously spend $8.99 for each set of hair accessories or props. Even if it cost gems that would be better than money. I would address some of the problematic racial issues but I read a few comments before mine who summed those up perfectly.

I even tried spending money to get hair accessories, props and prior season clothes, spent a lot of money over the past couple of months (it s embarrassing)and I still can t keep up with higher levels. Plus if you spend money on hair accessories you only get access to one style on lower levels. It s more suited for higher level players who have access to all the styles. It s not right that I spend the same money as the higher levels $8.99 yet I don t get the same access. I m not going to spend anymore money on a game that gives me an unfair advantage. Also if you don t have a lot of closet money or diamonds, you re low level etc you can t compete in more than a couple of events a day. I have an issue with categories like nursing, political figures, business women being in inappropriate clothing like crop tops, sequin outfits, ball gowns and cocktail dresses that keep winning.

This has been a pain for me because when a challenge interests me, I am always having to check every little thing to make sure that I am able to do the challenge. You can join a Fashion House, which allows you to chat and ask opinions on an outfit or challenge. BUT. You need to always check my chat and participate because they can kick you out if f my fashion house. Another thing I don t like is that it takes so long to get the results. I understand that when in voting it may take a while, but I think voting times should be closer to 4-6 hours. Waiting 18 hours for a mobile outfit is unrealistic. A suggestion to help this would be have a calculation process. It could help by additional points on an outfit, but also help the rating results being calculated during the voting.

Covet could have provided alternatives and made the burden less on the players (enabled limited in-house borrowing, loosened some requirements, increased the daily player payout temporarily or something else). Instead they just kept going while players got more and more frustrated. Then, with it was all over, they gifted all players with something that the most active players can t use (They gave prop tokens to people who already had all the props. And since there is a limit to how many tokens can be stored, anyone who already had that limit because there were no props left to buy just didn t get the prize to use on another occasion.)

After about 5 minutes I closed the app and opened it immediately back up to see that my order wasn t in my orders list and didn t go through. I checked my account settings and they did store my address and card information though which is weird if my order didn t go through how did you save my information? I contacted customer support and they were no help 3 times they explained a time limit after I explained to them 3 different times I IMMEDIATELY checked out and the app didn t load. I then lost the free gift offer because of this lag/bug in their app and they were no help to me to receive my free gift which I still was paying the shipping for. or even to give me an explanation as to why it happened, only saying the excuse of a time limit which doesn t apply because as soon as I made my account and received the free gift offer I immediately checked out and the app endlessly loaded which cost me the free gift offer and never put my order through but somehow saved my card information.. Customer support needs to do a lot better, maybe actually read what is sent to them and try to help not give an automated message about a time limit which has nothing to do with the situation they were contacted about."

Contacted Customer Support , here you are asked specific questions that doesn t even comes close to what my problem is, so you try to make the best selection that may come close to my problem. You have to take pictures of the item with a ruler for measurement purposes. After I went through all of this, Wish CS contacts me and says that the company correctly filled my order, therefore, my problem has been resolved. No it s not!! If you read the return policy you have 30 days to return my item. The policy says to go to consumer support and click on Return Form, this does not exist, once you click on CS you re automatically connected with a CS worker and from there on is just a menu of possible reasons to select from as to why you re unhappy with my order. Because the company sent my order correctly that s it I m done, there s no way I can return this one item because according to them my problem was resolved. I order two other items from Wish around May 10, and I still haven t received them. They pushed the delivery date back to June 14, today is June 15 still don t have my items, they ve pushed the delivery date back again, this time it s July 4.

So I had no way to contact customer support with my issue. I tried another day to do it and it finally let me upload the photo but by then it said they couldn t issue a refund because it had passed the timeframe. I tried to explain why I couldn t send my request sooner but they didn t care. They just kept sending me an automated response and closing my request without resolving the issue or acknowledging that the app wasn t working. But lesson learned that I will never attempt to buy clothes on here again (or anything). But especially clothes. I normally wear an xl or 2xl but on wish even a 5xl is too small for me. Their clothes are a joke and they re really cheap quality. I ve gotten some earrings I like on the app but some of them have come broken. And I ve ordered several things that never arrive. Plus the items really aren t that cheap when you consider how much shipping you pay per item. They make you think it s cheap and then charge a ton for shipping. So no, this website is not worth it and the customer support is terrible."

When using the coupon codes, a lot of the discounts don t go towards shipping do you get either buy a product for $2, get a 5% discount, and pay $3 for shipping, or you can get a free product, but pay $5 to ship it. You just have to be careful. THEIR LIMITED LIMITED QUANTITY DEALS ARE A SCAM! Sorry for the caps but out of the 60 attempts to get an item during one of these deals, none, absolutely none, have gone through. I don t understand why they do this as it just pisses the customer off. They do give you a refund but make sure my card company allows for several credits. This was fine print that I ve never known about. My credit card company, that I ve had for over 5 years, only allows 4 credits per day, and after that, they charge. So to clarify: I thought I was getting a deal, was very excited for the deal, but then found out it was false. They refunded me the $2. Since I d bought 8 items at $1/piece, and $1 shipping for each, I was refunded my $16, then charge $10 for each of the 4 additional refunds. In other words, I paid $40 for items that I ll never get. Because of this, I ll stick to Hollar, overstock, and Zulilly. TL/DR: use this app sparingly, don t expect to get what you pay for(and in cases of quality, sometimes you get exactly what you pay for). And you might end up losing money."

I finally (I think) got in touch with a live person, after 20 minutes of sending the same message over and over, they said they couldn t offer an alternative way to send the item back and that their site is having technical difficulties at the moment and I should try again tomorrow. I then asked for a customer service number and they stated we currently do not offer that option. I wonder why.probably because they would get bombarded with angry customers. I am pretty sure the return link isn t going to work tomorrow either so I will either have to try to get in touch with another agent, or just not send the item back. I WOULD RECOMMEND EVERYONE NOT USE THIS COMPANY OR WEBSITE. Most of the positive reviews on this site have to be fake because they are a couple words of positive review. Very disappointed Wish, you shouldn t be in business if you cannot offer the customer support needed to run a good company. I will be posting negative reviews wherever I can to warn people not to use this site."

As of my use of wish right now I am satisfied except for the shipping stuff and a pricing issue. Shipping is irritating as all hell for a couple reasons 1~ shipping is way to expensive often times it's more pricy then the product selected and there is no discounts for shipping 2) shipping takes a really really long time for a lot of items and they change the shipping date on you too so when you try to contact a wish support agent about it they tell ya that if it's not received by xx-xx-x (usually about 1-2 more weeks) then to contact them before a specific date to have the issue resolved. Now for the pricing issue I mentioned above, they false advertise the pricing on (not all but most) items they will say one price then they ask you to select my color or size when adding it to the cart then as soon as you select my choice 8/10 times the price changes and you can't find the product for the price it was originally set at for the product. Besides these things I am satisfied with my experience using wish and having this knowledge I keep it in mind when shopping with them"

I got a great deal on an item and received, not that item, but a letter and free gift. The gift was some pillow case with puppy pictures on it- useless to me. The letter explained that due to a quality problem at the factory, my item would be delayed 10 days. Wish, however, marked the item as received on the app once my letter was delivered so I contacted them with the photos they requested of my package and letter. At this point, I had been waiting for this item for well over a month and was hopeful that I would receive it- I told Wish this. However, they immediately issued a refund, which they falsely claim I requested, and have made no sense in my repeated email inquiries with them. They advised me to buy from another seller even though that took my price from $20 to $40 through another store. I ve done that and am still waiting for the item, but in my opinion, wish cancelled my sale and made me pay double without any explanation. Was the first store a scammer? Is the second store really the same scammer as the first? Have they heard of this letter/gift scam? I have bought many things from them, but since they won't tell me what is going on with this, I don't trust them anymore. I told them to help me understand this since I planned to write a review, but they have offered no assistance."

Four or five contacts about broken items made me blocked from contacting support about anything. The only way I may be determined to be back in good standing is to buy more. I am not about to go on a shopping spree on this sketchy website after my experience, just to be in good standing . Right now they re not in good standing with me. I can not ask questions about orders that have not arrived, or get refunds on orders that never arrived.

Sure you can write an email to the customer service but you most likely won t get help on anything. I m not the only person who s experience stuff being sent back but two days before I wrote this my cousin ordered something from Wish and his item was sent back. It was on its way then was canceled and being prepared to be sent back but then it said oh nevermind we ll just try harder to find my house. It sounds like whoever sends out stuff are lazy and can t handle their job. Which is probably true with Wish, people who work for wish are probably the underpaid people.

It blocked my account. I was confused and so I made a new one because i was just trying to buy a $15 gift card. it temporarily blocked that account. They said they needed a bank statement for my card or something so I uploaded one. After 24 hours they said it wasn t sufficient. At this point the money from my account was already taken out (the $15) I uploaded it again with a note saying something like I uploaded what was requested i m not sure what else i m supposed to include. And low and behold 24 hours after that they completely terminated my account. They said that more information on the matter would be in my email and to contact them for further questions. I looked in my email and nothing was clarified and it said that i couldn t reply to the email. So i tried to log in to contact customer service and because my account was terminated I couldn t contact customer service. They still have my money."

They want it all filtered through their ai bots first, but none of those issues apply which leaves me with no option to contact. This seems to be the better option since it is a website and app developer issue. Delivery instructions recently changed leaving far less available options and removing my selected option without notice. This last week I had been having packages left at the default front porch instead of my selected option the problem is my house is right in front of a city bus line and a high school bus stop we experience a lot of mail and package theft. My selected option (leave at back porch) had made the packages not visible from the street and experienced no theft for the last 18 months. if changes like these are made, the customer should be notified of the update instead of assuming it s the delivery driver not reading their screen. I do utilize lockers, but this isn t always an available delivery option."

I now HAVE to ask Rufus the idiot dog my question which takes twice as long since now I have to figure out how I want to word it. I realize that Rufus the idiot dog won t be euthanized since AI is such a big thing and every company must add it in order to not be left behind . But in the case of the questions would it be so awful to have Rufus available for people to ask their questions to AND let people look through questions. Why does it have to be one or the other? Why alienate my customers in favor of a robot? For reference I don t hate advancements in tech and am in my 20s. I just want things to be easy and this isn t that."

Funny because I had better delivery before I got prime, that says a lot about how they treat their customers that pay them monthly. Dont get me started on the deals & discounts . They list it on sale for the regular price or maybe A LITTLE cheaper. It s not worth it. Most of the coupons you have to subscribe to something to even get. I feel robbed because I only got prime for the deals thinking they d be worth it. I m lucky if I can get $20 off a $400 item. That s crazy. So essentially I m losing money every month paying for this because Im not purchasing anything because the deals are not worth it. It seems like none of the cheaper essentials go on sale! BOO ! It s always the crazy expensive things that go on sale that I don t need like a self cleaning litter box that gets discounted to $450 Yeah you get prime video, but they have a horrible selection and I have to watch ads on a streaming service I pay for and also don t use. I want the 2 day shipping and actual good deals that they claim that they have! I pay for the deals. WHERE ARE THE DEALS!?"

Especially when you go through the drop downs and have my car specifically put in to search for. My fav, so say searching for a cam for my car, always it says people often bought these together and has the cam you re looking at plus 2 more cams to two other cars. Like really . People often buy cams to two others cars or buy 3 cams for the same car together? Total garbage at best"

I have noticed that I often do not get an earthquake notice for about 30 minutes after it has occurred so you certainly don't want to rely on this app to save your life or give you real-time forewarning. It is useful though, especially if you pay close attention- you can see how an earthquake in one region will stimulate an earthquake in an almost opposite region. In this way, it can help you predict what may happen next.\n\nUpdate: I liked the app much better before it was updated. Before, the map was a satellite image and I could zoom in and explore the topography of the ocean floor and such. Now it’s just a cartoon image. I still gets alerts but I use the app much less now because of the crumby map. And thanks for the adding the ads...\n\nI upped my rating back to 5 stars for the developers quick and helpful response and showing me how to get my satellite image back. Thx:)",

The main issue with this app is its inconsistency in delivering timely notifications. This unreliability can be detrimental during critical situations when every second counts. On the positive side, when Emergency Alert does manage to send notifications, the information provided is accurate and helpful. Additionally, the user interface is clean and easy to navigate. However, these positives are overshadowed by the app's unreliability in delivering notifications. In emergency situations, users need a dependable system that they can rely on without any doubts. Unfortunately, Emergency Alert fails to meet this crucial requirement. In conclusion, while Emergency Alert provides accurate information during emergencies, its unreliability as an emergency notification system severely impacts its usefulness. Until the app addresses its notification delivery issues, it cannot be relied upon as a reliable emergency alert app.\n\nTo developer: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for your response.",

Granted no one knows if Cascadia will just break loose without warning but I’d like to think there will be lots of tremors before it goes. This app is great for seeing fault behavior on a day to day basis around the world, if you’re so inclined to observe in that way. I get alerts that I customized based on distance from you, region, and magnitude. A 3.0 earthquake happened in Sumatra? I don’t care. A 7.5 magnitude happens in the same place? I’d like to know.  That said this app does not present real time data. It’s typically 15 minutes or so after the event. If I had a perceptible quake in my area, I’d feel it and then 15 minutes later the alert pops up. Oh gee, thanks. So it is not a usable warning technology. I’m sure that would depend on the use of better GPS sensors right on the faults themselves, which hopefully we’ll have in place one day.",

Getting alerts in real time is vital for everyone because quakes can happen anywhere, anytime, and this app delivers. I not only monitor my own region but importantly, that of my friends' in the often shaky Los Angeles area.\nIt's a bargain to buy the full version for a very nominal fee for the features you get, and the developers deserve every penny. They have configured fascinating world map details with fault lines, pinpoints for  quakes with magnitudes, and even mark major fires across the U.S. \nThey generously helped me with an issue when I was a \"free\" user so they support their product all the way. Anyone who is interested in earth sciences, the \"quickening,\" or just staying safe needs QuakeFeed!",

I don't live near Mexico and it was not a part of my alert settings that I configured. When I went back in to change the notification settings I received multiple errors saying the app couldn't connect to the notification server. I tried multiple times and when I did finally get in there was a new notification configured that I didn't set up. When I tried to delete it it said the same thing about not being able to connect to the notification server. The ads were unexpected to just show up after I clicked on something and pretty annoying to have to wait five seconds to get to what I clicked on. One extra star because I could limit my notification to only the state I live in. But ultimately this app doesn't work. And maybe given more than 10 minutes this app would work, but I had it set up and something happened to make it not work.",

I was in class while classmate was giving a presentation and the earthquake notification was alerted before the wave of the earthquake his our building in SF. About 30-60sec before and I was so impress cuz that would be enough time to run away from the glass walls in case they shatters. But in the last year this amazing app seems to be notifying late. I just got a notification 5mins after an Earthquake hit in Berkeley. The last couple have been around the same delay time.  So heads up to the tech people working on the app cuz this is an amazing app and there is something off in the delay of notification on the app. 5 mins after an earthquake hits near you is way to late. Especially since for years it’s notifications seemed to be under a minute from impact. Use to a notification first then seconds later the building being hit by the wave or shaking from quakes in the local region.",

Love how you can set features to your own level of notifications. How you can sort through all the quakes by intensity and change back and forth between the list and the map. Update! I hate the map now. Hard to read and the list is too big. Now only a few visible on the screen at one time. Too much scrolling. Looks too cartoon like. The colors are awful. Very disappointed for me, not an improvement. Was easy to look at the map and know what’s was going on but not now. Not going to recommend it to anyone any more. Not all “Changes are improvements”.",

I probably don’t know how to use every feature but what I do use works perfectly every time. It has never crashed and never failed to give plenty of details about every quake on earth. \n\nI have mine set to alert me to any quake 6.0 or higher. All number it gives out are true except those in the states. But I believe the USGS downplays all US quakes by .3 to make them sound lighter than the actual. That happens regularly. Example, QuakeFeed alerts me to a 7.4 in Alaska, ten minutes later the USGS says it was a 7.1, so thats all I can say about that. \n\nPlease keep up the good work. And Thank you for a great product",

Anyone living along the Ring of Fire should have an earthquake app for safety.  You can customize alerts any way you want- by magnitude, distance, date, etc, so you won’t be alerted for events that don’t interest you.\n\nMy feedback is for the “Erupting Volcanos” feature.  \nWhile a little red pyramid is fine for active (rather than dormant or extinct) volcanoes, it would be helpful to have more information, at a glance, on the volcanoes which are actively erupting.  \n\nFor example, the Las Palmas (Canary Islands) volcano is in the midst of a violent, destructive eruption, but the icon is no different than hundreds of other active volcanos.  \nMaybe active volcanoes could have a green icon and erupting ones red or something.  Also, there could be a blurb of current information when one clicks on the icon, other than to simply give its size, coordinates, and a link.\nBasic information about the current eruption could be on the info page, the same as with earthquakes, without having to click on a web URL",

I'm not sure if this is because the USGS SoCal alerts are more sensitive, but it does work for me as an alert system. However, I still use the county Emergency Alert app as well. \n\nThe amount of information you can get from QuakeFeed is amazing, especially historical USGS. Seeing the shake impact of the 1906 is impressive. I really like the \"nearby earthquake\" alert as I do travel to the Bay Area in occasional. Also, the app has several useful map selections, including fault lines and earthquake risk level.\n\nMost of the advanced features require a subscription, but it is very reasonably priced with a free trial period.

Glad you separated magnitudes by color, but it seems odd that you used a dark color for the smallest, & a light color (yellow) for the next larger category. It would be more logical for the colors to become more intense as the magnitude becomes more powerful/destructive, so that they stand out. My mind is constantly skipping over the yellows. Maybe it's just the intensity of the yellow? Not sure.",

For example, any quake within a few kilometers, any 3+ on my island, and any 6+ in the Pacific (tsunami threat).\n\nThe reason I’m leaving.  The user interface for everything I can think of is cluttered, non-intuitive, and can overwhelm.  This became extra obvious when I suffered an eye injury and the app doesn’t follow the iOS settings for dark mode and font sizes.  Even if there is a setting somewhere, I had no way to find it.

This morning I saw a headline of a 1.8 quake about 20 miles from my home. The app was set to notify me of quakes above 3.0. so I changed my setting. I was hoping to see the quake listed following the change, but I didn't. Developers is this a flaw in the app, or is that how it's supposed to work? I'm wondering if I can trust it, so 2 stars for now.\n\nUPDATE- my bad. I was hoping to see the quake after I had lowered my setting to 1.8 but the developer replied that it does not work retroactively. If we ever do have a quake of 1.8 or more I look forward to seeing it on the map. I'll try to remember to write another update if and when that occurs but given my location don't hold your breath 😊. \nThank you developers - keep up the good work.",

Unfortunately it recently stopped pulling data from everywhere except the Mediterranean and Middle East regions, so I thought I would try My Earthquake Alerts. Unfortunately the layout isn’t as good as QuakeSpotter. It’s especially annoying that the map is only shown on less than half of the screen and the rest of the screen shows recent earthquakes. On QuakeSpotter these were on separate screens accessible via the menu.",

Great locating, easy to view when map options are low, tectonic fault only that do define strike/slip or subduction and appears up to date w/i few minutes. Challenges: map a bit too generic needs terrain relief(not aerial) standard illustration like on old maps. The earthquake points could be exaggerated a bit more as to size of quake. Color scheme is lost when adding population density which should be a blue scheme or grey scheme not the same as quakes. All faults, volcanos and hot springs should be noted in map too. Lastly a history button for locations pulled up that either integrates with a site like USGS or even just to a search engine and allow you to chose. This is the free version and I didn’t see any of this advertised for premium so until I see ideas such as these or better I won’t go premium. Cheers",

I only wish living here in California that it could also give advanced warning of an upcoming earthquake.",

It is only $2.\n\nBut, I was annoyed that the app’s apparent push to upgrade made it impossible to enjoy the app, or maybe that was a hiccup. After I upgraded, it kept insisting I should upgrade. Sending a message to support uncovered a problem with their web form. I never received a reply.\n\nI finally resolved my own issues with this app after updating iOS 11. Now using it with iOS 13. Works well. \n\nIf not for the hassles, and lack of support response, I’d give this 5 stars. (I am pretty stingy on star ratings. Five stars needs to be simply top notch, without any major and few if any minor issues.)",

Don't seem to be able to do that. *Which technically wouldn't need to if the area where one can usually specify how far from where they live, can be added, i.e., \"Up to 800 miles from my location\". \n\nI'm amazed this app is being rated anywhere near as good as it has.",

If so, that's a tool we have built in the app to show how an earthquake's motion is an all-around impact instead of \"up and down\" or \"side to side.\" Also, this built-in sensor collects data when in stationary mode and contributes to our global seismic network. As for the frozen screen, we're very sorry for this inconvenience. Currently, we're experiencing a data overload for the recent earthquake which explains why the app is frozen as you try to report it. The Developers are working hard to find a fix, we appreciate your patience at this time. Thanks!",

But that’s not really the issue here, might just be me but running iPhone X and it seems to freeze for a while whenever I click on a specific earthquake to see more info about it.\n\nEdit: seems to only be freezing on ones that happens around a day or so ago, when I clicked on one that happens 20 mins ago it worked fine but the one that happens in pleasant hill a day or so ago (aswell as others ) it freezes.\n\nEdit 2: the app now shows an earth quake in the pinnacles, CA as 3.5 however yesterday it showed as a 3.6 and when I click on the 3.5 it then shows 3.6 at the bottom.",

But now I live in Los Angeles California and I don't know how people in the US are gonna react when they get the warning a strong earthquake is coming because people In Mexico are already use to getting them alerts that say \"Strong earthquake is coming  \" since they have so many strong earthquakes and an early warning on their phone and they had them for a while . So since this is gonna be new to people in the US who knows how they gonna react ! Also I think we need the Alarm. I know that they have them were they have tornadoes in the US  .But in Mexico city when u get the notification on your phone the Air raid siren also goes on really loud all over the city the first time I had no idea what was happening I tought a war was happening when I heard the alarm all over the city till I saw everyone running outside and they were screaming earthquake and sure enough 30 seconds later BAM strong earthquake hit  . They should have those in California not only in places were they have tornadoes  so people can have time to go hide ! I saw it helps they had about 30 seconds to get outside .",

My phone made a very distinct sound and said something to the effect Earthquake alert, drop, cover, 5.7 Kern County. I was at first a little unsure, as I hadn’t felt anything, then I knew I better get out of laying on the electric lounge chair so I can at least sitting up so I can be ready to move, then I opened Maps to see where Kern County was, it said 111 miles away. I moved to a better area in my house, then started feeling and hearing slight shaking. Then I took a video of our pendant light swaying slightly. Exciting, thankfully not too exciting. Next time I’ll be less unsure and just act much quicker, it could be less time, closer and bigger I know! Important and so so helpful! Thank you!!!!! Very cool!!!\n\nThat’s what I wrote previously, back here again to say thank you, had new early warnings today of quakes, thank you!!!! You are amazing, love this important precious app!!!!",

Yes there is a sw bug that the app doesn’t seem to do anything after setting the home base, but if you go back through the settings the home base has indeed been set. Home base is essential to me since I run with location tracking off to save battery capacity. I run with a VPN so we’ll see if the app works with that. It would be great if there was a test mode that would allow a user to verify notification and trigger off any earthquake of any magnitude 3.5 or greater in California, Oregon or Washington.\n\nI would also like a notification of ANY deep earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone in case there are any precursor earthquakes providing early warning.",

So I expected so see a weather alert… nope, it was a alert that & actually spoke that said something to the effect of “earthquake detected, seek shelter.” So I did, but felt nothing. About 20 seconds as I was watching the news, they interrupted their story & said reported a earthquake alert. I got the alert (it seems) before they did. Then the newscaster reported that some lights in the studio were shaking. \nSo even though I personally did not feel it, people I know did & I am grateful that I got the earthquake warning. This app gave me time to seek shelter. I highly recommend this app for anyone who lives in earthquake areas, and wants to be safe. \nThank you.",

I was six during the ‘89 quake and still remember how the shaking felt like it was yesterday. Any kind of advance warning will be helpful.",

About 10 seconds later, the earthquake hit us and the whole house rolled with the quake. And we are 100 miles away from epicenter!! \n\nThe app display earthquakes all over the world or nearby you depending on your personal preference.

Approximately two weeks ago, a very loud voice stated “EARTHQUAKE”, then something to the effect of “TAKE COVER” (the exact words used after EARTHQUAKE escape me, but it was telling me, basically, to prepare). This jarring message repeated a few times. I immediately jumped to a safer place. Fortunately, the quake, in Tulare County, California, was far enough away that it didn’t do too much where I live. I must say though, that I am now a super fan of this app. The split second it takes to jump to a safer spot could make the difference between life and death, especially for us in California.

The issue is if you live right next to the fault, you won’t get much of a heads up, so stop putting negative reviews. The San Andreas for instance can definitely give Los Angeles City residents a few seconds of a warning since the San Andreas is not under LA city. There is no way the app can predict earthquakes so please understand the science before you give a review.\nIt’s an app to save lives. It works well.

And when I get an earthquake alert it is usually very fast and very loud. That’s actually a good thing. However, it’s probably human error that caused my biggest issue with the app. One night this week I was woken up at around 3:20 AM for an accidental test alarm. It’s such a loud, jarring alert that it really caused me to panic for a moment. Then it took me a very long time to get back to sleep, making getting up on time the next morning miserable. I think there needs to be much better processes and layers of checks in place for whoever has access to send test alarms.",

Not enough of a warning for me to act in time in the middle of the night, but if a bigger quake hit further away, I can see how the app can save lives or prevent serious injuries. \n\nThe bad news is that the app is an incredible battery hog.

The promotional materials at launch indicated it might provide a precious few seconds before an earthquake strikes. \n\nUnfortunately all of those seconds will be wasted because the notification provides practically zero information about the quake’s epicenter, and it is extremely difficult to view the relevant info on the map. If you tap the notification, you get an unsorted map of the globe and are left to yourself to infer which dot was the one that generated the notification. On top of that, you’ll be getting plenty of notifications for earthquakes thousands of miles away, so it’s more likely the notification is relevant to someone on the other side of the globe than it is to you. \n\nAll that added up, and it’s hard to see any value here in its current form.  Even if we assume the detection mechanism is cutting edge, the warning delivery is so completely flawed it negates its function.\n\nIt would be very helpful to only notify for nearby events, and to give actual location and approximate distance from current location in the notification text so you know right away.",

Plus the special abilities can get you through levels you have difficulty with. You learn geography and history along the way. The new version has a daily prize that is very aggravating. You get better prizes for playing every day but it arbitrarily resets you. Though I have not missed playing a level for years the farthest I have got is Day 119. About a week ago I was ready to get my prize for day 120 which is the 30 day landmark. To my dismay it restarted me instead. It has arbitrarily removed green gems before which take a lot to build, but otherwise this is a fun game that you can play in short time frames. The biggest improvement the game needs is an ability to change a resourcemart from one to another. Early on in the game mistakes are made because you don't know the strategy for the green gems and that after the first few cities you only get two of them instead of three. This is important for new players to know ahead of time.",

Instead of bells and whistles that do nothing but confuse the players who have barely adjusted to the previous update, why not add something that actually makes the game more interesting?  For instance - the side path prizes- make them a choice. Many times I don’t need a million bricks, or whatever,  but a power up would be very nice. \n, \n\nUPDATE : it's very possible to earn enough coins with the free version of the game if you're willing to be patient and play all three levels of each number as well as the side paths. That way, you can earn 100 coins per number. (10, 30, 60).  I rarely buy extra moves, I just play til I win or use the spinner.... I now have 28,000+ coins I earned just by waiting it out. \nJust one request: PLEASE give an option to turn off the hint function. I love match 3 games but they usually have no \"carrot\" to attain other than stars. This game is complex enough (but by no means a brain strain) with 3 levels of accomplishment at each individual level, buildings to construct with the winnings, coins to earn to buy lives, treasure chests to unlock, and it's tough enough that I use up my 3 lives pretty fast. If you're lucky you might win extra moves or lives on a spin board...super cute game. Big Fish hit it out of the park with this one. It's fun and I'm hooked.",

Unfortunately it has been 6 weeks since they opened a new city. Two years ago they were introducing new cities every two weeks. During COVID they were able to transition and keep pace though new cities were unlocked every 3 weeks like clockwork. It was so reliable I could set my watch to it. They recently introduced an “Elite” playing mode to tie players over until new cities open and now that I’ve been playing for weeks in the absence of a new city, I realized I’m playing against bots, which is FRAUD. Three weeks in a row I was beat by “Karen,” who miraculously jumps 25-40 levels with an hour. The person behind me is always “June.” It’s frustrating that they don’t want real players to take 1st place and accumulate awards — so they almost force you to spend for rewards and it should be illegal. I have screenshots for the past 4 weeks and seeing that evidence of bots has created such distrust that I’m close to quitting the game after playing daily for nearly 4 years. That and no new cities is making this game close to obsolete and worn out in my life.",

I was on Los Angeles city and finally made it through a red step and the very next step had that pop-up that said “hard level-try a boost”!   NO - I just went through a hard level which was clearly marked with a red badge!!\nAlso, I don’t know why you bother putting up those word ones where you have to solve the step to get one letter of a word.

I add this after reading other reviews:  though I agree with a few of the frustrations mentioned, I feel it is right to stand up for Big Fish in one particular way.  Reviewers keep mentioning their \"greed,\" forcing serious players to use real world money to fully complete every city.  First, completion of every city is an option. Second, can you imagine the hours, days, weeks worth of work the Gummy Drop creators of put in? And this is their livelihood! They need some people to make real world purchases to keep making the game. We become too accustomed to the Internet giving us music and shows and games without needing to pay for them.

I love the challenge of each puzzle except for those that are literally impossible to successfully win without the aid of boosts. I have appreciated Gummy Drop specifically because most of the puzzle challenges can be won with patience and perseverance. Most of the other games in this genre force you to buy boosts to continue the game. Gummy Drop allows you to earn so much more in the way of coins and boosts than any of the other games. Gummy Drop is a fair game. Mostly. Recently I have played a bunch of puzzles that are increasingly difficult and seem to be impossible to beat unless you use boosts. I don’t like that. I want to know that I can ultimately beat the game on my own merit and not use boosts to win. Lately it seems as if Big Fish is intentionally making the puzzles impossible to beat forcing the players to buy boosts in order to move forward in the game. Perhaps the CEO sent them a memo directing them to force the players to spend more money. Thanks capitalism. 😩\nAnd enough with the sand!  It’s so annoying.",

I even spend way more money than I would like to admit. But lately, it costs money to complete almost any city or any challenge. It is ridiculous. Secondly, the slot machine in Tokyo was one of the things I liked the most, a little guilty pleasure. Then you took that out, promising something even better! So I waited, and waited…. Finally you finished construction on the matching game. It’s not as fun as the slot machine, and there are no rewards, no matter how perfectly you complete all matches! Very disappointing. I feel that you lied about something bigger and better! And it seems as though every level of every game has far too many obstacles. Does every level have to include both a time bomb AND sand traps AND ice AND AND AND AND…. It’s about time to call it quits if something doesn’t change.",

I wish the game allowed a player to transfer from any port to any port in order to drill for gems.  The other option would be to allow all earnings of gems and coins to travel with the player or be available to the player at all times. I enjoy going to Tokyo to play the slot machine, but I don’t like doing multiple trips to each city to collect resources and then shipping to a different city in order to build a site.  I don’t like waiting four hours shipping time and then another trip to collect in order to spend in another city.\nOverall it is a great game.

Therefore I am stuck on certain levels that require you to purchase boosts or more moves in order to complete them.  Almost quit recently as I was stuck on same level for weeks. Then an upgrade was performed, and the level I was stuck on had a completely different puzzle (a much easier one), allowing me to proceed a little. Very frustrating way to play.\nHere is a suggestion that may keep me playing.  How about a lightning bolt \"bank\"?   Any bolts that are left at the completion of a level can be placed in that bank, instead of being used to raise the score. A lightning bolt used from the bank could be placed at random spot, not one directed by the gamer.\n\nI still play, but still stuck on higher level in one city at the same spot for months now. Not willing to spend money or coins so I guess that city will remain incomplete.

No reaction or answer from Big Fish re: my 'bank' suggestion from earlier review. I guess it is all about the money!",

It’s always been chintzy that players are only given 3 lives. It’s the only game I’ve ever played that doesn’t start you with at least 5. But this time around I’m experiencing different irritations. I agree with another reviewer about the large ads that block out the screen that prevent you from closing the screen and getting the reward due you. Now I’m in a spot where I have a level that has what I guess could be called a “bonus round.” Collect shells and decorate a cruise ship and get a reward. You have a generous time allotment of days to do this. It worked ok until I got to the point I had 18/20 of the options. I have plenty of shells (2,408) to finish the decorating and the game keeps prompting me to finish it and get the reward. However when I go in there, the last 2 options to decorate will not come up. And the time has almost run out. This game is enjoyable but there a lot of flaws and malfunctions that really should be addressed by the developers.",

It would be nice if the cities had a difficulty level and you could travel to lower rated cities to play on days when not feeling up to a challenge or coins need to be stockpiled to complete the difficult cities.\n\nAlso, the DAILY Reward is a misnomer as you have to actually WIN a level to receive the DAILY reward, not just play. Learned that the hard way...only had time to run through one set of lives in a difficult level on day 27 but was not offered the reward. The next day I logged in and...back to day 1 I went. I also agree with other players that it would be nice to have boosts and coins as reward on occasion, there were occasional coins when it first started (the first week) but that was quickly changed. I was hoping Day 30 would have coins but haven’t made it there yet! \n\nOverall a fun game, I just may have reached my fun limit.",

I get through 10 spaces and then have to go back for a long time to repeat the levels I did. To get the highest scores on. I also think they need to have a way that you can get more boosts without having to pay for it. Also, there should be an information center that explains what each boost is again. They explain it when they introduce a boost, but honestly the picture of the boost does in no way give a clue as to what it is.  I generally have to google it each time, which is annoying. There should just be an info button to access what each boost is and other details.  The reinforcement I get is not enough, when I have to keep repeating the same levels to move forward. I am on the Berlin level, and not enjoying it as much as I did in the beginning. Also I really don’t like the times levels that must, would like to have much fewer!",

They want you to spend money to get items to help you through the tough levels. \nNow there are a few things I hate about this game and they are easy fixes. First off every so often they give you free minutes either as a daily prize or for something else. You have to use it immediately. I open up the app to collect from the factories every morning before work. The daily prize pops up and if it’s free minutes it goes to waste as I’m about to head to work. And that’s another thing I hate. I have factories in three cities but I won’t build more because it’s too time consuming to open up each city to collect. I would be willing to pay a few dollars for a tool to gather from all factories automatically when they are full. And lastly the constant tournaments weekly have me spending more time replaying a certain level to gather what I need to hold my ranking than trying to complete another city. How about limiting the tournaments to once a month?",

I have been playing this game for a few years now and one of my goals has been to finish a city before moving to the next. The games I am faced with have made this impossible. Don't get me wrong I love a challenge, but these games are no longer a challenge they are just plain impossible. You have these games so hard you have to use multiple purchase and buy a lot of other things to be able to potentially win. Then you throw in games where you have to beat multiple things and also get so much of one particular shape/color that the game never provides. You can’t even buy these things so you know that people have no chance in hell if ever winning these levels. \nEven when completing a different short term challenge you are gypping people. I came in third on the most recent challenge and all I received is 15 free minutes. That is a joke. You have no opportunity to win coins in these smaller games but sometimes have to use coins to be able complete them with any chance of winning. I under stand this is a business you but please consider the faithful people who play your games and treat them fairly. \nVery disappointed!!!!!!!",

Aside a few times that I’d be stuck on a level for weeks then seems maybe they’d finally lower the standard or something. I don’t pay for boosts and others quit when got to levels when had to in order to beat it. The new update that gives you treasure everyday is convenient unless you miss a day however you only when needed prizes like shovels and such like once a month. I’m very picky about using boosts. I’ll be out soon and if that is there way of making people spend real cash then I’ll be done with this game also. I like the game takes some skill but can also be just a relaxing distractions. However I hate timed levels. They require total concentration during the whole time. So have to pause the tv or if on lunch break too stressful and won’t play. I personally could do without them and do agree with another rating. The World greatest messages etc if you get good points makes it so you can’t see the board and you lose time.",

We got to a level you could ONLY complete by buying power ups. I bought a few, but no more. I am the last of my friends to say enough! This is the same experience I had with Midnight Castle. Played it faithfully for a couple of yrs until it became nearly impossible to advance without spending money. I didn’t! Quit that game, too. Good bye!\n\nAs noted by others: you can't play the game very long because there are only 3 lives. You have to BUY the other 2 lives ( which I won't do.) you can't save coins because you earn so few and the cost of using features costs disproportionately much more. I've considered deleting the game because it is just so frustrating to make any real progress in the game. I reviewed the developers of all the games I play and by far Big Fish Games is the greediest. You just can't advance very far without spending a boat load of money. I used to play this game daily. Now I open it a few times a week and shut it down when the three lives are gone. I won't download any more Big Fish games until they they change their money grabbing policy.",

When attempting to enter a game, you have to touch the banner several times before it lets you in.  That alone is extremely frustrating, but there's more.  Resource buying page is bad beyond belief. The goals necessary on the left-hand side have become somewhat disjointed and you no longer can see how much of what type of non-goal related resources you are accumulating. Everything used to be quite intuitive at a glance.  This is no longer the case.  I so wish the so-called usability and/or design experts would leave well enough alone rather than attempting to enhance things that don't need fixing.  I've seen this happen, unfortunately, to several apps so this one is not alone.  Message to designers - follow general usability standards and governing principles.  Stop over-designing just to do so.  Message to app coder management - turn your designers into usability experts.  Don't redesign unless it provides benefit.",

I get alerts that I customized based on distance from you, region, and magnitude. A 3.0 earthquake happened in Sumatra? I don t care. A 7.5 magnitude happens in the same place? I d like to know. That said this app does not present real time data. It s typically 15 minutes or so after the event. If I had a perceptible quake in my area, I d feel it and then 15 minutes later the alert pops up. Oh gee, So it is not a usable warning technology. I m sure that would depend on the use of better GPS sensors right on the faults themselves, which hopefully we ll have in place one day."

I was in class while classmate was giving a presentation and the earthquake notification was alerted before the wave of the earthquake his our building in SF. About sec before and I was so impress cuz that would be enough time to run away from the glass walls in case they shatters. But in the last year this amazing app seems to be notifying late. I just got a notification 5mins after an Earthquake hit in Berkeley. The last couple have been around the same delay time. So heads up to the tech people working on the app cuz this is an amazing app and there is something off in the delay of notification on the app. 5 mins after an earthquake hits near you is way to late. Especially since for years it s notifications seemed to be under a minute from impact. Use to a notification first then seconds later the building being hit by the wave or shaking from quakes in the local region."

I have mine set to alert me to any quake 6.0 or higher. All number it gives out are true except those in the states. But I believe the USGS downplays all US quakes by .3 to make them sound lighter than the actual. That happens regularly.

Anyone living along the Ring of Fire should have an earthquake app for safety. You can customize alerts any way you want- by magnitude, distance, date, etc, so you won t be alerted for events that don t interest you. My feedback is for the Erupting Volcanos feature. While a little red pyramid is fine for active (rather than dormant or extinct) volcanoes, it would be helpful to have more information, at a glance, on the volcanoes which are actively erupting. For example, the Las Palmas (Canary Islands) volcano is in the midst of a violent, destructive eruption, but the icon is no different than hundreds of other active volcanos. Maybe active volcanoes could have a green icon and erupting ones red or something. Also, there could be a blurb of current information when one clicks on the icon, other than to simply give its size, coordinates, and a link. Basic information about the current eruption could be on the info page, the same as with earthquakes, without having to click on a web URL"

Great locating, easy to view when map options are low, tectonic fault only that do define strike/slip or subduction and appears up to date w/i few minutes. Challenges: map a bit too generic needs terrain relief(not aerial) standard illustration like on old maps. The earthquake points could be exaggerated a bit more as to size of quake. Color scheme is lost when adding population density which should be a blue scheme or grey scheme not the same as quakes. All faults, volcanos and hot springs should be noted in map too. Lastly a history button for locations pulled up that either integrates with a site like USGS or even just to a search engine and allow you to chose. This is the free version and I didn t see any of this advertised for premium so until I see ideas such as these or better I won t go premium. Cheers"

The San Andreas for instance can definitely give Los Angeles City residents a few seconds of a warning since the San Andreas is not under LA city.

It s such a loud, jarring alert that it really caused me to panic for a moment. Then it took me a very long time to get back to sleep, making getting up on time the next morning miserable.

Unfortunately all of those seconds will be wasted because the notification provides practically zero information about the quake s epicenter, and it is extremely difficult to view the relevant info on the map. If you tap the notification, you get an unsorted map of the globe and are left to yourself to infer which dot was the one that generated the notification. On top of that, you ll be getting plenty of notifications for earthquakes thousands of miles away, so it s more likely the notification is relevant to someone on the other side of the globe than it is to you. All that added up, and it s hard to see any value here in its current form. Even if we assume the detection mechanism is cutting edge, the warning delivery is so completely flawed it negates its function. It would be very helpful to only notify for nearby events, and to give actual location and approximate distance from current location in the notification text so you know right away."

You get better prizes for playing every day but it arbitrarily resets you. Though I have not missed playing a level for years the farthest I have got is Day 119. About a week ago I was ready to get my prize for day 120 which is the 30 day landmark. To my dismay it restarted me instead. It has arbitrarily removed green gems before which take a lot to build, but otherwise this is a fun game that you can play in short time frames. The biggest improvement the game needs is an ability to change a resourcemart from one to another. Early on in the game mistakes are made because you don't know the strategy for the green gems and that after the first few cities you only get two of them instead of three.

This game is complex enough (but by no means a brain strain) with 3 levels of accomplishment at each individual level, buildings to construct with the winnings, coins to earn to buy lives, treasure chests to unlock, and it's tough enough that I use up my 3 lives pretty fast.

Unfortunately it has been 6 weeks since they opened a new city. Two years ago they were introducing new cities every two weeks. During COVID they were able to transition and keep pace though new cities were unlocked every 3 weeks like clockwork. It was so reliable I could set my watch to it. They recently introduced an Elite playing mode to tie players over until new cities open and now that I ve been playing for weeks in the absence of a new city, I realized I m playing against bots, which is FRAUD. Three weeks in a row I was beat by Karen, who miraculously jumps levels with an hour. The person behind me is always June. It s frustrating that they don t want real players to take 1st place and accumulate awards so they almost force you to spend for rewards and it should be illegal. I have screenshots for the past 4 weeks and seeing that evidence of bots has created such distrust that I m close to quitting the game after playing daily for nearly 4 years.

I add this after reading other reviews: though I agree with a few of the frustrations mentioned, I feel it is right to stand up for Big Fish in one particular way. Reviewers keep mentioning their \"greed,\" forcing serious players to use real world money to fully complete every city. First, completion of every city is an option. Second, can you imagine the hours, days, weeks worth of work the Gummy Drop creators of put in? And this is their livelihood! They need some people to make real world purchases to keep making the game. We become too accustomed to the Internet giving us music and shows and games without needing to pay for them.

Also, I think that once a person has done everything in a city except buying all the cards, we should be able to reverse redeem them, for example instead of paying 500 coins to get hats or bricks, we should be able to redeem all those bricks and hats that we ve accumulated and EARN back the coins! I have played faithfully for years. I even spend way more money than I would like to admit. But lately, it costs money to complete almost any city or any challenge. It is ridiculous. Secondly, the slot machine in Tokyo was one of the things I liked the most, a little guilty pleasure. Then you took that out, promising something even better! So I waited, and waited . Finally you finished construction on the matching game. It s not as fun as the slot machine, and there are no rewards, no matter how perfectly you complete all matches! Very disappointing. I feel that you lied about something bigger and better! And it seems as though every level of every game has far too many obstacles. Does every level have to include both a time bomb AND sand traps AND ice AND AND AND AND . It s about time to call it quits if something doesn t change."

My life is extremely busy so playing time is a treat to myself. With the variety of the different levels it s not monotonous. I know to diversify when building resource ports. I wish the game allowed a player to transfer from any port to any port in order to drill for gems. The other option would be to allow all earnings of gems and coins to travel with the player or be available to the player at all times. I enjoy going to Tokyo to play the slot machine, but I don t like doing multiple trips to each city to collect resources and then shipping to a different city in order to build a site. I don t like waiting four hours shipping time and then another trip to collect in order to spend in another city. Overall it is a great game. I have had my coins disappear without me spending them, I wrote a note to the customer service people, yet nothing was done about it. It s still a really fun game."

Then an upgrade was performed, and the level I was stuck on had a completely different puzzle (a much easier one), allowing me to proceed a little. Very frustrating way to play. Here is a suggestion that may keep me playing. How about a lightning bolt \"bank\"? Any bolts that are left at the completion of a level can be placed in that bank, instead of being used to raise the score. A lightning bolt used from the bank could be placed at random spot, not one directed by the gamer. I still play, but still stuck on higher level in one city at the same spot for months now. Not willing to spend money or coins so I guess that city will remain incomplete. Was not going to update my review, many disparaging comments from other gamers re: those of us finding certain levels very difficult. No reaction or answer from Big Fish re: my 'bank' suggestion from earlier review. I guess it is all about the money!"

It s always been chintzy that players are only given 3 lives. It s the only game I ve ever played that doesn t start you with at least 5. But this time around I m experiencing different irritations. I agree with another reviewer about the large ads that block out the screen that prevent you from closing the screen and getting the reward due you. Now I m in a spot where I have a level that has what I guess could be called a bonus round. Collect shells and decorate a cruise ship and get a reward. You have a generous time allotment of days to do this. It worked ok until I got to the point I had 18/20 of the options. I have plenty of shells (2,408) to finish the decorating and the game keeps prompting me to finish it and get the reward. However when I go in there, the last 2 options to decorate will not come up. And the time has almost run out. This game is enjoyable but there a lot of flaws and malfunctions that really should be addressed by the developers."

I also think they need to have a way that you can get more boosts without having to pay for it. Also, there should be an information center that explains what each boost is again. They explain it when they introduce a boost, but honestly the picture of the boost does in no way give a clue as to what it is. I generally have to google it each time, which is annoying. There should just be an info button to access what each boost is and other details. The reinforcement I get is not enough, when I have to keep repeating the same levels to move forward. I am on the Berlin level, and not enjoying it as much as I did in the beginning. Also I really don t like the times levels that must, would like to have much fewer!"

They want you to spend money to get items to help you through the tough levels. Now there are a few things I hate about this game and they are easy fixes. First off every so often they give you free minutes either as a daily prize or for something else. You have to use it immediately. I open up the app to collect from the factories every morning before work. The daily prize pops up and if it s free minutes it goes to waste as I m about to head to work. And that s another thing I hate. I have factories in three cities but I won t build more because it s too time consuming to open up each city to collect. I would be willing to pay a few dollars for a tool to gather from all factories automatically when they are full. And lastly the constant tournaments weekly have me spending more time replaying a certain level to gather what I need to hold my ranking than trying to complete another city. How about limiting the tournaments to once a month?"

Don't get me wrong I love a challenge, but these games are no longer a challenge they are just plain impossible. You have these games so hard you have to use multiple purchase and buy a lot of other things to be able to potentially win. Then you throw in games where you have to beat multiple things and also get so much of one particular shape/color that the game never provides. You can t even buy these things so you know that people have no chance in hell if ever winning these levels. Even when completing a different short term challenge you are gypping people. I came in third on the most recent challenge and all I received is 15 free minutes. That is a joke. You have no opportunity to win coins in these smaller games but sometimes have to use coins to be able complete them with any chance of winning.

The new update that gives you treasure everyday is convenient unless you miss a day however you only when needed prizes like shovels and such like once a month. I m very picky about using boosts. I ll be out soon and if that is there way of making people spend real cash then I ll be done with this game also. I like the game takes some skill but can also be just a relaxing distractions. However I hate timed levels. They require total concentration during the whole time. So have to pause the tv or if on lunch break too stressful and won t play. I personally could do without them and do agree with another rating. The World greatest messages etc if you get good points makes it so you can t see the board and you lose time."

Played it faithfully for a couple of yrs until it became nearly impossible to advance without spending money. I didn t! Quit that game, too. Good bye! As noted by others: you can't play the game very long because there are only 3 lives. You have to BUY the other 2 lives ( which I won't do.) you can't save coins because you earn so few and the cost of using features costs disproportionately much more. I've considered deleting the game because it is just so frustrating to make any real progress in the game. I reviewed the developers of all the games I play and by far Big Fish Games is the greediest. You just can't advance very far without spending a boat load of money. I used to play this game daily.
